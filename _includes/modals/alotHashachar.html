Dawn is the time that rays of sun can be seen in the lit up Eastern part of the sky (Rosh, Brachot 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Yoma 3:1; Shulchan Aruch O.C. 89:1). Halachically, it is the time that we transition from night into day, where the new day's commandments can start being fulfilled (although in an unideal fasion; preferably, these should wait until הנץ החמה/sunrise. However, if one has already done it erroniously or has a pressing need, they are still exempt).

- The Night-Time Shema (when omitted due to negligence), Tikkun Hatzot, and the evening prayer are no longer recitable past this time.
- Despite this being an unideal time to pray, considering that its obligation has started, one may no longer eat until the end of his prayer.
- Wearing Tallit & Tefilin requires Misheyakir, as they have an explicit start time within Brachot Bavli.

The Talmud Bavli in Pesachim (92b-94a) presents a debate regarding how to measure the time between sunset and calculative nightfall, which is then matched to the time interval from dawn to sunrise. Practically, we hold by Rabbi Yehuda's interpretation of the time interval being 4 "mil". Since a singular mil is 18 minutes (Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Brachot 1:1 & Shulchan Aruch O.C. 459:1), one can multiply the length of a mil by the amount of mil needed to find that Alot is 72 minutes before sunrise. These minutes are adjusted to the length of the day (making them "seasonal" minutes), when the day's sunrise and sunset time internal is divided into 12 to make it an hour, which is then further divided into 60 to make a seasonal minutes.
- The Rambam in "Pe'er HaDor 44" (written in Arabic) clarifies which methodology of calculating a minute's length is. The Minchat Kohen (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג)'s interpretation is that these are seasonal use seasonal minutes, which is what's followed by R' Yosef Haim (בי"ח ש"א: וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צו ח; בי"ח ש"ב: נח ז; רב פעלים ח"ב: סימן ב) and Maran zt'l (הליכות עולם ח"א: דף 106 ודף 248-250). This is also supported by the Mishnah Brurah (58:5) and Yalkut Yosef (58:3).
- The definition of *calculative* nightfall (72 seasonal minutes) is not to be confused with what we *halachically* maintain nightfall is (13.5 seasonal minutes).

Whereas the Ohr Hachaim calendar uses this calculation regardless of the latitudinal discrepancies, the Amudeh Hora’ah calendar argues (based on several authoritative sources of early Acharonim) that this is erroneous. This is also supported astronomically, where the latitude degree increase on the globe also proportionately delays the time for nightfall and dawn. Instead, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar dictates that each locale must determine its own number of seasonal minutes, based on its relation to Israel on an equinox day (where sunrise and sunset are aligned, which by default gives a control of fixed minutes). To calculate this, one needs to derive the level of darkness (measured by degrees) in the sky found in Israel by the desired time (in our case, 72 minutes before sunrise), which can then be applied as a percentage of the day to the desired locale.
