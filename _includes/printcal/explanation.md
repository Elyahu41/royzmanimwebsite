###### Sunrise / Sunset

Sunrise (“Netz”) is defined as the time when the uppermost edge of the solar sphere is first visible in the east (astronomically, this time is approximately six minutes prior to a full solar reveal)<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ם (סדר אהבה) הלכות קריאת שמע א':י"א לפי גרסת כסף משנה, רב פעלים חלק ב' או"ח פרק ג'</span></span>. Sunset (“Shekiya”) is defined with the complete setting of the sphere in the west.<span class="footnote">הלכה ברורה (הקדמה לסימן רס"א הלכה כ"א). עוד בילקוט יוסף מהדורה חדשה סימן פט דף ת"ס</span>

Calculations are using the NOAA algorithm for the exact geolocation<span class="footnote">See the דברי יוסף (61a). Most Posekim say that the entire city should rely on one time, yet that isn't feasable without much more geographic data and clarity from the Posekim themselves</span> used when creating the calendar, with elevation factored for users of the Ohr Hachaim calendar (even though elevation is not used when reporting the "sunrise" & "sunset" times on the calendar itself).

Those who aim to pray תפילת שחרית by sunrise<span class="footnote">לפי פסוק בתהלים ע"ב:ה' “יִֽירָא֥וּךָ עִם־שָׁ֣מֶשׁ” - “They will fear you with the sun”</span> should instead use a pre-downloaded "Visual Sunrise" time<span class="footnote">משנה ברורה תקפ"ח:ב' לפי שיטת רש"י ורן במגילה כ'; אשל אברהם מבוטשאטש או"ח סימן פט; ילקוט יוסף מהדורה חדשה סימן פ"ט דף נא</span>, which closer matches the historical definition of sunrise<span class="footnote">תלמדי רבינו יונה על ברכות ד: בדפי הריף</span>. For our PDF generator, the user generating it would have needed to go through our "Visual Sunrise Setup" on our website, found in the description field for sunrise.

###### Seasonal Hour

A seasonal hour is generally calculated by adding together the hours between sunrise and sunset and then dividing by twelve. The consequent result represents a singular halachic seasonal hour. It is important to mention that regarding specific halachot, like the earlier end time for Keriath Shema, and the latest time to eat חמץ on ערב פסח, the seasonal hour is calculated from daybreak until nightfall (three stars).

For time portions calculated outside of the sunrise->sunset range, we continue to use seasonal minutes<span class="footnote">לפי מנהג הספרדים - רמב"ם פאר הדור מ"ד, הליכות עולם א' דפים קו ורמח-רנ</span>, without regards for the astronomical discrepencies between seasons and their lengths of days not corresponding to how long sunset->astronomical nightfall<span class="footnote">See authorities above; as well as, Minḥat Cohen 2 4, Pri Ḥadash Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8, Bet David 104</span> (through solar degrees). However, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar accomodates latitudinal adjustments<span class="footnote">Minḥat Cohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8), Bet David (104), Gra (261), Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13). The Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 261 page 755) concurs in regard to Motzeh Shabbat but distinguishes that one may be lenient regarding rabbinical matters (like awaiting nightfall for Mikvah, or end of fasts) after sunset (even in high latitude places like France). In this regard, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar follows the ruling of Halacha Berurah (above) which is the position mentioned in all the early authorities (above) and accurately corresponds to the physical circumstance.</span> by applying the astronomical degree for that time to the destination's equinox day, measuring the minutes between them and making _those_ minutes the seasonal count (so 13.5 minutes after sunset in Israel becomes 16.5 minutes after sunset in NY). From there, we now have a calendar that matches the Ohr Hachaim calendar in Eretz Yisrael as well closer matches the astronomy for other lands.

###### Dawn

Dawn is the time that rays of sun can be seen in the lit up Eastern part of the sky<span class="footnote">ראש על ברכות ד':א', רמב"ם פירוש המשניות יומא ג':א', שלחן ערוך או"ח פ"ט:אי</span>. Halachically, it is the time that we transition from night into day, where the new day’s commandments (like not eating before praying) are imposed, meaning one can already start fulfilling day-based commandments<span class="footnote">ראה שלחן ערוך (או"ח) בהרבה סעיפים (נח, פט, תקפח, תרנב, תרפז). ראה עוד ביו"ד סימן רסב</span> (even though one should preferably wait until sunrise under most circumstances; they are still exempt if they've done the commandments erroniously or had a pressing need to do so)

###### MiSheyakir

MiSheyakir is defined as the time when there is just enough light that one can recognize an acquaintance from close proximity, as well as distinguish between white & tekheleth<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">שתי הזמנים האלו אותו דבר: ראה בית יוסף סימן נ"ח ד"ה 'ומ"ש ומצוה'</span></span>. This equates to a seasonal hour prior to sunrise, yet one can already be lenient from 66 seasonal minutes prior to sunrise in a case of need.<span class="footnote">הליכות עולם א' דף י"ט</span>

Practically, one may say Shema from now, as well as make blessings on <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">טליתות ותפילין</span>.<span class="footnote">שלחן ערוך או"ח סימנים י"ח, ל' & נ"ח</span>

###### Keriath Shema End Time

This time is the end of the third halachic hour of the day (calculated from sunrise until sunset)<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ם (סדר אהבה) הלכות קריאת שמע א':ו"א, סידור רב סעדיע גאון דף י"ב, ביעור הגר"א או"ח תנ"ט:ב'</span></span>, by when people of luxury would arise in the morning. The Sages codified this time to have one completely read קריאת שמע before then<span class="footnote">ר' יהושע משנה ברכות א':ב', שמואל ברכות בבלי י:</span>, based on the word ובקומך (as one rises) used when discussing the obligation to recite it morning and night.

However, some are stringent to read קריאת שמע at an earlier calculation of three seasonal hours after Dawn<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">חיד"א (שו"ת חיים שאל) ב' ל"ח:ע', בא"ח (פרשת ויקהל ד', רב פעלים ב':ב'), כף החיים נ"ח:ד', תרומת הדשן א'</span></span>. Although one should be stringent by this opinion<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">הליכות עולם א' וארא ג'</span>. This is especially relevant when the Maghen Avraham (58:1) interprets the sunrise->sunset opinions to hold differently by שמע</span> due to the rule of "we always hold stringent by Biblical doubts", those who weren't able to should still say קריאת שמע by the later time.

###### Keriath Shema Blessing End Time

By the time one third of the day has passed (which will be by the end of the fourth seasonal hour), one must have already recited the blessings of <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">קריאת שמע</span><span class="footnote">רא"ש ברכות י: בשם רה"ג, סידור רס"ג זף יג, שלחן ערוך או"ח סימן נ"ח, פתח דביר ב' דף יח בשם רב חיים וייטל</span> and should have finished praying <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">תפילת שחרית</span>.<span class="footnote">שלחן ערוך או"ח סימן פ"ט</span>

###### Ḥametz End Time

In addition to the <span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">איסור דאורייתא</span><span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי"</span></span> to own and derive benefit from חמץ after midday, right before בין הערבים<span class="footnote">אביי בפסחים ה.</span> on ערב פסח, there is an additional Rabbinic safeguard by the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> Halachic hour to forbid eating חמץ and the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> Halachic hour to forbid owning <span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">חמץ</span>.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רבי יהודה במשנה פסחים א':ד', רמב"ם (סדר זמנים) הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ט'</span></span>

Although the usual method of calculating seasonal hours is from sunrise until sunset, we are stringent on חמץ to consider these two Rabbinic times through the seasonal hours normally reserved for Biblical times<span class="footnote">פרי חדש תחילת סימן תמ"ג & חזון עובדיה ב' דף ל"ז</span> (such as Keriath Shema) by calculating them from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall. For children, there is a leniency to use the sunrise->sunset seasonal hours if they want to still eat חמץ.<span class="footnote">חזון עובדיה פסח א' דף ס' & ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשע"ה) דף תרנב</span>

###### Ḥatzoth - Midday & Midnight

Ḥatzoth is the time precise midpoint in the day/night (depending on whether it's חצות היום or חצות הלילה<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">חזון עובדיה, ימים נוראים דף ג'</span></span>), which is calculated by dividing the time between sunrise to sunset (or sunset to sunrise) in half. There are halachic implications for both:

{:.fakeListItem}
One can no longer pray Tefilath Shaḥarit past midday.<span class="footnote">שלחן ערוך או"ח סימן פ"ט</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
There are various rules night-based rules (such as Seliḥoth, Taḥanun by Keriath Shema al HaMittah, Pesaḥ's Seder Night amongst others) that depend on when Halakhic midnight is.

###### Minḥa Times

The earliest one can pray Minḥa (“Minḥa Gedolah”) is a seasonal half hour after the halachic midday.<span class="footnote">שלחן ערוך או"ח סימן רל"ג. הליכות עולם א' דף רנב</span> In the event the seasonal half hour is less than thirty fixed minutes the more stringent calculation of the fixed thirty minutes is imposed.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">הלכה ברורה סימן רל"ג הלכה ג'</span></span>

However, it is preferable for one to wait until the 9.5<sup>th</sup> seasonal hour into the day<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">ילקוט יוסף רל"ג:א'</span></span>, as this is the time for "Minḥa Ketanah". We list both times, should one be in need of praying earlier.

###### Plag Haminḥa
Plag Haminḥa is, as the hebrew name implies (Plag=half), the halftime point from Minḥa Ketanah until sunset. A select few mitzvot of the night can start being done from now, such as accepting Shabbat early<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">שלחן ערוך (או"ח) רע"ג:ד'</span></span> or praying Tefilath Arvith when one already prayed Minḥa.

The definitional method to calculate this time would be to measure the time between Minḥa Ketanah and sunset (which spans 2½ seasonal hours, thereby making פלג המנחה last 1¼ seasonal hours) and apply the split time backwards from the time called "ערב". Determining when "ערב" is, though, is disputed between R' Avraham Yosef + R' Yitzhak Yosef<span class="footnote">ילקוט יוסף, מהדורה חדשה, סימן רע"א דפים קלט & קמד-קמז</span> (who say it's from צאת הכוכבים) vs R' David Yosef<span class="footnote">סימן רס"ג הלכה ל"ז. ראה עוד בכף החיים רל"ג:ז' הליכות עולם א' דפים ק"ו ורמ"ח</span> (who says it's from sunset). Although the position of the Halacha Berurah seems more compelling, the opinion of the Yalkut Yosef is indeed supported by many authorities as well. Therefore, one may choose to follow either opinion in practice. The calendar has followed the general seasonal hours (from sunrise to sunset) for calculating Plag, even within the method of the Yalkut Yosef.<span class="footnote">Like the Agur (end of 327), although the Terumat Hadeshen (siman 1) disagrees. This is also the practice of Luach Ohr HaChaim based on the ruling of Maran Harav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l.</span>

###### Night (Three Stars)

Night in halacha is defined by the emergence of three stars.<span class="footnote">Massechet Shabbat 35b</span> Many Torah laws are predicated on the beginning of the night<span class="footnote">Such as ending Tefilath Minḥa (Y.Y. 235 5), Hefsek Taharah (Taharat HaBayit vol. 2 pages 265-274), Shvut beMakom Mitzvah on Friday afternoon (H.B. 261 1), Earliest Keriath Shema of night (S.A. 235 1) and of many other mitzvot.</span>. Regarding most mitzvot, night begins 13½ seasonal minutes after sunset<span class="footnote">Maharam Al-Ashkar (siman 96) and see Maran in Shulḥan Aruch (siman 459 law 2 & Yoreh De'ah siman 69 law 6).</span>. Calculating this time in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar is also subject to the adjusted seasonal minutes definition, as described in the "Seasonal Hour" section.<span class="footnote">Some may wonder: How is it possible for three stars to be visible in such a short time after sunset? Several authorities explain that the sign of stars is indeed not so easily discernable to the average person (even with good vision and visibility) because they are miniscule points within a broad picture, requiring even a faint star to be fixated on (while knowing where it would even first appear) prior to being able to discern it (ספר "לילה ויום של תורה" דף קע"ה והזמנים בהלכה ב' דפים תפ"ח-תצ"ג) in contrast to the vastly large sky background (יביע אומר ז' מ"א:ז' בשם גרא"ז, פני יהושע, גר"א). Light pollution is also a factor, which means that those living in cities are simply unable to see three stars immediately as they emerge.</span>

For the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar, the stringent time for night uses an identical methodology of calculating night except it places night at twenty seasonal minutes after sunset<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ם פירוש המשנה פסחים ג':ב'</span></span> instead of thirteen and a half. This time is meant to be used for listing the time of the end of fasts<span class="footnote">חזון עובדיה ארבע צומות דף יב. שיטת הבא"ח (א' ויקהל הלכה ד) ואור לציון (א' יו"ד סימן י') שצריכים לחכות לכ"ז דקות אחר שקיעה שיהיה לילה ודאי</span> and regarding assessment whether to perform a Brit Milah on Shabbat (“Bizmano”).<span class="footnote">ראה עוד בשלחן ערוך (יורה דעה) סימן רס"ו:ח-ט & יביע אומר ז' סימן מ"א לבער</span>

###### Motzaeh Shabbath (+ Yom Tov)

Although the appearance of three stars is not astronomically different between the 7<sup>th</sup> day (or days that Yom Tov fall out on) and others, the severity of Shabbat/YT itself demands that one not have any doubt before doing melakha<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">שלחן ערוך או"ח רצ"ג:ב'</span></span>. Although the context of that message was specifically in reference to when people are determining this time astronomically, even our position of 13.5 seasonal minutes is debated<span class="footnote">To avoid any potential Shabbat descecration, we have chosen to hide this time for any Shabbat/Yom Tov. Those looking to use it for legitimate purposes (such as the latest time one could start שעודת שלישית בדיעבד) should look to applying this time *from the prior/following day* (whichever is more stringent).</span> by many different factors (excluding the matter of doubt supporting R"T):

{:.fakeListItem}
This time should be determined **astronomically** (as indicated by the wait of a cloudy day).<span class="footnote">Keep in mind that the legal letter of the law still needs to be accounted for, so fixed minutes is used as a minimum.</span> One cannot use seasonal hours for this, since the length of the day does not determine how long it'll take until astronomical nightfall.

{:.fakeListItem}
The time measurement is as long as **27 minutes**.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">בי"ח, (שנה ראשון) ויקהל ד', אור לציון א' יו"ד סימן י'</span></span> This is based on the Stringent Nightfall's 20-minute *mil* with an additional 7 minutes to account for the מוגרב.

Based on both of these reasons, Maran Ovadya ruled that the Ohr Hachaim calendar should list Motzaeh Shabbath as 30 minutes after sunset<span class="footnote">See Yehave Da'at (vol. 7 siman 56) Yalkut Yosef (New Edition siman 293 page 715). See Zivchey Tzedek (vol. 2 y.d. siman 17 page 66 & vol. 3 siman 104 page 198).</span>. However, there is an issue on how to transport that to the other areas of the world, especially since the latter claim of astronomical reality is one of the things Maran was concerned about that. To resolve the issue, there are two approaches:

{:.fakeListItem}
The Amudeh Hora'ah calendar chose to interpret the astronomical reality as degrees that the sun is below the horizon (which matches 7.14º on the spring equinox day in Israel). In terms of fixed minutes after sunset, this time will vary based on both location and season (meaning a location like New York will have nightfall be after 36-42 minutes). A 20 fixed-minute minimum is in place for lands like Panoma which are closer to the equator and as such would have a quicker nightfall than Israel.

{:.fakeListItem}
The Ohr Hachaim calendar mode sticks with the consistent fixed minutes logic, meaning the same minutes will be used irrespective of the astronomical difference between the two. To properly accommodate latitudinal astronomical differences, our default option is 40 minutes after sunset, based on a private ruling by Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz.

###### Rabenu Tam

Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l held very strongly that for Motzeh Shabbat and Yom Kippur one should be stringent and abstain from melakha and most Rabbinic decrees until 72 seasonal minutes after sunset.<span class="footnote">Yabia Omer (vol. 2 siman 21) and many other locations.</span> However, many other authorities held that this isn’t essential lehalacha since historically only extremely pious individuals waited this long to take out the Shabbat.<span class="footnote">ראה באור לציון ד' פרק כ' הערה ב' וגם השיטות שבמקורות של מוצאי שבת</span> Nevertheless, the time is listed in this calendar, to afford those that wish to be strict that information. Based on the halachic rulings of both R' Yitzhak Yosef<span class="footnote">ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה חדשה) סימן רצ"ג דף תשכד</span> & R' David Yosef<span class="footnote">הלכה ברורה, הקדמת לסימן רס"א הלכה י"ט</span>, the 72 minutes for the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar are calculated in <b>the lesser</b> of two formats: 72 fixed minutes or 72 seasonal minutes.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">יודעי בינה ז':ו'</span></span>

###### Molad (New Moon) - Announcing & Birkath Halevana

After the moon disappears once it completes its cycle, the moment that the moon "reappears" is called the Molad (birth) of the new moon. It occurs at a specific time every lunar month, and it's what we use as a basis for knowing when to recite ברכת הלבנה.

In the days before Hillel the 2<sup>nd</sup>, people who saw the new moon became witnesses for the Sanhedrin, where they would get interviewed to confirm their testimony (that it occured either that day or the night prior) and let Sanhedrin declare that day as ראש חדש. In the event that no witnesses came to testify, ראש חדש would be announced for the following day. However, with our absence of a Sanhedrin, Hillel the 2<sup>nd</sup> established a formula to calculate the molad's for the foreseeable future until we have a Sanhedrin again. This formula is what all jewish calendars use today to determine how long a month is and how long ראש חדש would be.

The Molad is usually (in terms of Halacha) calculated as hours and Ḥalakim (where each Ḥelek is an 18<sup>th</sup> of a minute, making up 1080 Ḥalakim in an hour). These are calculated using Har Habayit's local time, which factors in its own timezone<span class="footnote">The Israeli Standard/Daylight Timezone is centered to encompass Israel as a whole. However, timezones themselves are a recent creation dating back only a little over one hundred years ago, and is not reflective of the time of Har Habait themselves. As such, the average of Ḥatzot times on Har Habait is not 12:00 exactly but rather 11:39.</span>, which then happens at that moment everywhere else in the world<span class="footnote">Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin z”l (Edut LeYisrael page 146b letter 15) and many many more. See Amudeh Hora'ah (vol. 4 Biur Hora'ah siman 428).</span> (factoring in that, say, a molad on Sunday at 1:06 AM IST in Israel would be on Saturday night at 6:06 PM EST in New York due to timezone adjustments).

The practice of Ashkenazic communities (as well as some Sepharadic ones) is to announce the result of this formula during ברכת החדש. However, we omit this information in our calendar due to it not being part of the normative Sepharadic custom<span class="footnote">חזון עובדיה חנוכה דף רנח</span>. Communities looking to continue their tradition of announcing it should be careful to not follow the misleading ways that, in addition to not doing the proper adaptions (see paragraph above), fail to add the hours to the mean-sunset time<span class="footnote">Rabbi Yonah Martzabach z"l in sefer Aleh Yonah (page 35) who rejects Rav Tikuchinsky z"l's viewpoint (Ben HaShmashot page 102) to consider night in this regard as 6 fixed hours after midday of the prior day in any given time of the year.</span> and instead apply the time from the arbitrary "12:00 AM". Instead, they should add the hours and Ḥalakim from 5:39 PM IST, ensuring that daylight savings is not used.

---

Although the earliest time to recite ברכת הלבנה is <i>three</i> complete days after the calculated molad<span class="footnote">משנה ברורה תכו:See Mishnah Berurah (siman 426 letter 20).</span>, it is preferable (if possible, and wouldn't lead you to lose out on the Beracha<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 363). See, Kaf HaChaim (426 62) & Ohr LeTzion (vol. 3 chapter 4 law 6) who disagree with this leniency.</span>) to wait <i>seven</i> days instead, as per our Sepharadic tradition.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">שלחן ערוך, סימן תכ"ו הלכה ד'</span></span>

The latest time to recite Birkat HaLevana according to Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l is the end of the night of the fifteenth of the Jewish month.<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 349). It is important to note that here we would certainly go based on each locations respective time since this measure is not fixated on the molad rather on the date itself.</span> However, one should initially try to be stringent for the opinion of the Rama<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">שלחן ערוך או"ח סימן תכ"ו:ג'</span></span> and recite the blessing before the midpoint of the two Molad's.<span class="footnote">Ruling of Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l pertaining to calendar Ohr HaChaim. Especially in light of the opinions that there is a question of beracha levatalah after this time (ראה רב פעלים ב' סימן לח, כף החיים תכו:נ & נג, אור לציון ג' פרק ד' הלכה ו').</span>

###### Tekufa

Tekufot are the Halachic equivalents of the yearly solar seasons, which we have four of yearly; Nissan/Spring, Tamuz/Summer, Tishri/Fall & Tevet/Winter. There are practical concepts that depend on when the beginning<span class="footnote">רש”י על שמות ל”ד:כ”ב - “שֶׁהִיא בַחֲזָרַת - בִּתְחִלַּת”</span> of each Tekufa falls out:

{:.fakeListItem}
Outside ארץ ישראל, we switch the text of תפילת שמונה עשרי from ברכנו to ברך עלינו after 60 days into Tekufat Tishri<span class="footnote">ש”ע או”ח קי”ז:י”א</span>. Although this currently corresponds to December 4<sup>th</sup> (or December 5<sup>th</sup>), this will drift outside of those days as the years go.

{:.fakeListItem}
There is a Kabbalistic warning to not drink plain water at the moment the Tekufah begins<span class="footnote">רמ”א על יורה דעה קט”ז:ה</span>, for it is a time of spiritual danger<span class="footnote">פרי חדש על ש”ע או”ח סוף סימן תכ”ח מזהיר על חשש המוות. יש גם תעם לפי פשת: לעורר אותנו בתשובה (תשובות הגאונים (מוסאפיה) סי’ י”ד)</span>. We customarily developed a "time-buffer" for before and after this time, totaling in an hour where one would observe this restriction (30 minutes before and after)<span class="footnote">הליכות אולם ז' דף קפג, נהר מצרים, דף עז ע”ב, ר’ אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט”ז אות ה. יש הרבה מנהגים על זה, החל חצי שעה שהם ט"ו דקות לפניו ולאחריו (חיד”א, שו”ת יוסף אומץ סימן מ”ב) או שש שעות (מנהגי מהרי”ל בליקוטים של סימן נו), שהם שלושה שעות לפניו ולאחוריו. המנהג המפורסם שלא שוטים מים שעה ומחצה לפניו ולאחריו</span>
There is a custom that developed not to drink plain water at the beginning of the Tekufah itself. Beyond those who follow this for the simple reason of starting off the Tekufah with something important<span class="footnote"></span> (for the sake of having a "rare event" to capture people's attention), the concept is stressed in a stronger fashion among Kabbalistic circles, warning of the spiritual danger that befalls during this time . As such, some took an additional “time-buffer” before and after the time. Although they range from 15 minutes<span class="footnote">חיד”א, שו”ת יוסף אומץ סימן מ”ב</span> to 3 hours <span class="footnote">מנהגי מהרי”ל בליקוטים של סימן נו</span>, the common customs have been to wait either an hour and a half prior and following<span class="footnote">רב מזוז על מנהגי דג'רבי ; רמ”ך בברית כהונה - חלק או"ח מערכת ת’ אותיות כ”א-כ”ה</span>, or half an hour prior and following<span class="footnote">נהר מצרים, דף עז ע”ב; ר’ אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט”ז אות ה</span>. Maran Ovadya concludes like the latter of the two, as recorded in Halikhot Olam (vol. VII, pg. 183).

{:.fakeListItem}
Once every 28 years, we recite a special blessing thanking God for creating the sun when it returns to the same time<span class="footnote">6:39/7:00 IST.</span> and place that it occupied when it was created. This is done on the morning after Israel's<span class="footnote">(even if a timezone would dictate earlier/later)</span> Tekufath Nisan, where everyone prays by sunrise to recite the Beracha as soon as they can.<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadia Berakhot pg. 479. Those who could not do it by then should still try to do it by the third hour</span>

----

Finding out which days mark the start of a season is as easy as knowing when one of them is and just adding/subtracting the length of a season.

{:.fakeListItem}
The length of a season is determined by taking the length of the year divided by four. Since we hold<span class="footnote">שמואל (Bavli Eruvin, 56a). As the Ḥazon Ish (OC Siman 138, se'if katan 4) explains, things that each person should calculate for themselves use rounded values, like for the diameter of a Sukkah.</span> that a year is 365.25 days, dividing that into four gives us a season’s length of 91 days, 7 hours and 30 minutes.

{:.fakeListItem}
The first season (as indicated by when we say ברכת החמה) is for the month of Nisan, which is used as our reference point.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">משנה תורה, הלכות קידוש החדש ט':ד'</span></span> When translating these clock-times (6:00 AM, 12:00, 18:00 & 24:00) into timezone-based times, there is a dispute whether these are using Har Habayit's timezone offset of -21 minutes (as the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar & unofficial לוח ילקוט יוסף subscribe to<span class="footnote">Rav Aharon Boron in תנובות שדה</span>) or sticking to the IST-based times (as the Ohr Hachaim calendar subscribes to<sup>Rav Tuchanski</sup>). The only area where this actually makes a difference is the water-warning, yet it's possible to accomodate both by starting the fast using R' Boron's time and ending using R' Tuchanski's time.<span class="footnote">This only affects the 30 minute shita Maran zt"l followed.
