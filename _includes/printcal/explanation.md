###### Sunrise / Sunset

Sunrise (“Netz”) is defined as the time when the uppermost edge of the solar sphere is first visible in the east (astronomically, this time is approximately six minutes prior to a full solar reveal)<span class="footnote">Rambam on Hilchot Kriat Shema (1:11), based on the כסף משנה’s גרסה, Rav Pa’alim Vol. II, Orach Hayim, Chapter 3</span>. Sunset (“Shkiya”) is defined with the complete setting of the sphere in the west.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 21). See Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 89 page 460).</span>

Calculations are using the NOAA algorithm for the exact geolocation<span class="footnote">See the דברי יוסף (61a). Most Posekim say that the entire city should rely on one time, yet that isn't feasable without much more geographic data and clarity from the Posekim themselves</span> used when creating the calendar, with elevation factored for users of the Ohr Hachaim calendar (even though elevation is not used when reporting the "sunrise" & "sunset" times on the calendar itself).

Although the typical "sunrise" time can work for Tefilat Hanetz<span class="footnote">based on the verse (Tehilim 72:5) “יִֽירָא֥וּךָ עִם־שָׁ֣מֶשׁ”; “They will fear you with the sun”</span>, the definition of sunrise has historically<span class="footnote">תלמדי רבינו יונה על ברכות ד: בדפי הריף</span> been "when the sun starts shinning on the hilltops". As such, one should use this separate time<span class="footnote">Mishnah Berurah 588:2 based on Rashi & Ran on Megillah 20; Eshel Avraham Botchach, Orach Hayim 89; Yalkut Yosef, new edition, siman 89 page 51</span> called "Visible Sunrise" when possible.

###### Seasonal Hour

A seasonal hour is generally calculated by adding together the hours between sunrise and sunset and then dividing by twelve. The consequent result represents a singular halachic seasonal hour. It is important to mention that regarding specific halachot, like earlier Kriat Shema end time, and last time to eat hametz on Erev Pesach, the seasonal hour is calculated from daybreak until nightfall (three stars).

For time portions calculated outside of the sunrise->sunset range, we continue to use seasonal minutes<span class="footnote">as per the Sephardic tradition; see Rambam Pe’er HaDor 44, Halichot Olam vol. 1 page 106 & pages 248-250</span>, without regards for the astronomical discrepencies between seasons and their lengths of days not corresponding to how long sunset->astronomical nightfall<span class="footnote">See authorities above; as well as, Minḥat Cohen 2 4, Pri Ḥadash Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8, Bet David 104</span> (through solar degrees). However, for latitudinal adjustments, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar accomodates this<span class="footnote">Minḥat Cohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8), Bet David (104), Gra (261), Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13). The Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 261 page 755) concurs in regard to Motzeh Shabbat but distinguishes that one may be lenient regarding rabbinical matters (like awaiting nightfall for Mikvah, or end of fasts) after sunset (even in high latitude places like France). In this regard, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar follows the ruling of Halacha Berurah (above) which is the position mentioned in all the early authorities (above) and accurately corresponds to the physical circumstance.</span> by applying the astronomical degree for that time to the destination's equinox day, measuring the minutes between them and making _those_ minutes the seasonal count (so 13.5 minutes after sunset in Israeli becomes 16.5 minutes after sunset in NY). From there, we now have a calendar that matches the Ohr Hachaim calendar in Eretz Yisrael as well closer matches the astronomy for other lands.

###### Daybreak

Daybreak begins 72 seasonal minutes before sunrise. All mitzvot associated with beginning of day, can be fulfilled from this point in time (even though preferably one should wait until Netz under most circumstances). All fasts that start in the morning begin from daybreak as well.

###### MiSheyakir

The time of MiSheyakir is when there is just enough light that one can begin recognizing an acquaintance from close proximity. Practically, one may say Shema from now, as well as bless on <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">טליתות ותפילין</span>.<span class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch (simanim 18, 30, 58).</span> Calculating it is preferabbly done from a seasonal hour prior to sunrise, yet one can already be lenient from 66 seasonal minutes prior to sunrise in a case of need.<span class="footnote">Halichot Olam (vol. 1 page 19).</span>

###### Keriath Shema End Time

This time is the end of the third halachic hour of the day (calculated from sunrise until sunset)<span class="footnote">Rambam (Kriat Shema 1:11), Rav Sa'adia Gaon (Siddur, page 12) and the Vilna Gaon (reflected in Biur HaGra on Oraḥ Ḥayim, 459:2)</span>, by when people of luxury would arise in the morning. The תנאים (Tanaic Sages) codified this time to have one completely read קריאת שמע before then<span class="footnote">R' Yehoshua in Mishnah Berachot 1:2, Shemuel in Talmud Bavli 10b</span>, based on the word ובקומך (as one rises) used when discussing the obligation to recite it morning and night.

However, some are stringent to read Keriath Shema at an earlier calculation of three seasonal hours after Dawn<span class="footnote">Ḥida (Shu"t Ḥayim Sha-al II 38:70), Ben Ish Hai (Rav Pa'alim 2:2 & BI"H Vayakhel 4), Kaf Hachaim (58:4) & Terumat Hadeshen (siman 1)</span>. As per the rule of the Halikhot Olam<span class="footnote">v. I Vaera III</span>, one **should** be stringent by this opinion since this is a matter of a Biblical commandment, especially when the Maghen Avraham (58:1) interprets even the earlier Poskim quoted above to hold by this time when it comes to Shema. However, one who did not manage to fulfil this stringency in time should still aim to say Kriat Shema by the later time measured from sunrise to sunset.

###### Birkhoth Keriath Shema End Time

This time is the end of the fourth seasonal hour of the day, by which point one must have recited the blessings of Keriath Shema<span class="footnote">Shulḥan Arukh, Oraḥ Ḥayim siman 58</span> and should have finished praying <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">תפילת שחרית</span>.<span class="footnote">Shulḥan Arukh, Oraḥ Ḥayim siman 89</span>.

###### Ḥametz End Time

In addition to the Biblical prohibition<span class="footnote">רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי"</span> to own and derive benefit from Ḥametz after Ḥatzoth Hayom/Ben HaArba'im<span class="footnote">אביי בפסחים ה.</span> on Erev Pesaḥ, there is an additional Rabbinic safeguard by the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> Halachic hour to forbid eating Ḥametz and the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> Halachic hour to forbid owning Ḥametz.<span class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda Mishnah Pesachim 1:4, Rambam Hilkhot Hametz Umatzah 1:9</span>

Although the usual method of calculating seasonal hours is from sunrise until sunset, we are stringent on חמץ to consider these two Rabbinic times through the seasonal hours normally reserved for Biblical times<span class="footnote">as recorded in the Pri Ḥadash, beginning of Siman 443 & Ḥazon Ovadya II pg. 37</span> (such as Keriath Shema) by calculating them from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall. For children, there is a leniency to use the sunrise->sunset seasonal hours if they want to still eat Ḥametz.<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya - Pesach I pg. 60 & Yalkut Yosef on Pesach (5775 edition) pg. 652</span>

###### Ḥatzoth - Midday & Midnight

Ḥatzoth is the time precise midpoint in the day/night (depending on whether it's חצות היום or חצות הלילה<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Yamim Noraim, page 3)</span>), which is calculated by dividing the time between sunrise to sunset (or sunset to sunrise) in half. There are Halachic implications for both:

{:.fakeListItem}
One can no longer pray Tefilath Shaḥarit past Ḥatzoth HaYom.<span class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch (siman 89)</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
For Ḥatzoth HaLaylah, there are various Halakhot (such as Seliḥoth, Taḥanun by Keriath Shema al HaMittah, ליל הסדר של פסח amongst others) that bear ramifications from when this time is.

###### Minḥa Times

The earliest one can pray minḥa (“Minḥa Gedolah”) is a seasonal half hour after the halachic midday.<span class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch (siman 233). Halichot Olam (vol. 1 page 252).</span> In the event the seasonal half hour is less than thirty fixed minutes the more stringent calculation of the fixed thirty minutes is imposed.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (siman 233 law 3).</span>

However, it is preferable for one to wait until the 9.5<sup>th</sup> seasonal hour into the day<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef 233:1</span>, as this is the time for "Minḥa Ketanah". We list both times, should one be in need of praying earlier.

###### Plag Haminḥa
Plag Haminḥa is, as the hebrew name implies (Plag=half), the halftime point from Minḥa Ketanah until Shekiya. A select few mitzvot of the night can start being done from now, such as accepting Shabbat early<span class="footnote">Orach Chayim, 273:4</span> or praying Tefilath Arvith when one already prayed Minḥa.

The definitional method to calculate this time would be to measure the time between Minḥa Ketanah and sunset (which spans 2½ seasonal hours, thereby making Plag Haminḥa last 1¼ seasonal hours) and apply the split time backwards from the time called "ערב". Determining when "ערב" is, though, is disputed between R' Avraham Yosef + R' Yitzhak Yosef<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147)</span> (who say it's from צאת הכוכבים) vs R' David Yosef<span class="footnote">Kaf Hachaim (233:7), Halichot Olam (vol. 1 page 106 & page 248) & Halacha Berurah (siman 263 halacha 37).</span> (who says it's from sunset). Although the position of the Halacha Berurah seems more compelling, the opinion of the Yalkut Yosef is indeed supported by many authorities as well. Therefore, one may choose to follow either opinion in practice. The calendar has followed the general seasonal hours (from sunrise to sunset) for calculating Plag, even within the method of the Yalkut Yosef.<span class="footnote">Like the Agur (end of 327), although the Terumat Hadeshen (siman 1) disagrees. This is also the practice of Luach Ohr HaChaim based on the ruling of Maran Harav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l.</span>

###### Night (Three Stars)

Night in halacha is defined by the emergence of three stars.<span class="footnote">Massechet Shabbat 35b</span> Many Torah laws are predicated on the beginning of the night<span class="footnote">Such as ending Tefilath Minḥa (Y.Y. 235 5), Hefsek Taharah (Taharat HaBayit vol. 2 pages 265-274), Shvut beMakom Mitzvah on Friday afternoon (H.B. 261 1), Earliest Keriath Shema of night (S.A. 235 1) and of many other mitzvot.</span>. Regarding most mitzvot, night begins 13½ seasonal minutes after sunset<span class="footnote">Maharam Al-Ashkar (siman 96) and see Maran in Shulchan Aruch (siman 459 law 2 & Yoreh Deah siman 69 law 6).</span>. Calculating this time in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar is also subject to the adjusted seasonal minutes definition, as described in the "Seasonal Hour" section.<span class="footnote">Some may wonder how it is possible for three stars to be visible in such a short time after sunset? Several authorities explain that the sign of stars is indeed not so easily discernable to the average person even with good vision and visibility (see Yabia Omer vol. 7 siman 41 letter 7 in the name of Gra”z, Pnei Yehoshua, Gr”a). The reason behind this is as follows: Interestingly, the nature of the eye is as such that it is unable to immediately detect miniscule points within a broad picture! So, in order to see a small faint star in contrast to the vastly large sky background the eye must actually be fixated upon the star for some time before it can even discern it. This means that one must actually know ahead of time where the star is going to first appear and have his eye already focused on that precise spot and only then will he be able to see it at its first point of visibility (see Sefer “Layla VeYom Shel Torah” page 175; HaZemanim B’Halacha vol. 2 page 488-493). Additionally, in cities it becomes impossible to see three stars immediately at their emergence because of the street and housing lights that drown out the emerging light of the stars.</span>

For the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar, the stringent time for night uses an identical methodology of calculating night except it places night at twenty seasonal minutes after sunset<span class="footnote">See Rambam Pirush HaMishna (Pesachim 3:2).</span> instead of thirteen and a half. This time is meant to be used for listing the time of the end of fasts<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Arba Tzomot page 12). The Ben Ish Ḥai (vol. 1 VaYakhel 4 & vol. 2 Vayetzeh 1) & Ohr LeTzion (vol. 1 yoreh deah siman 10) hold to wait 27 minutes for it to be certainly night.</span> and regarding assessment whether to perform a Brit Milah on Shabbat (“Bizmano”).<span class="footnote">See Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 266 law 8-9) and Yabia Omer (vol. 7 siman 41) for more details regarding the case.</span>

###### Motzaeh Shabbath

Although the appearence of three stars is not astronomically different on the Shabbat day, the severity of Shabbat itself demands that one not have any doubt before doing Melakha<span class="footnote">Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayim 293:2</span>. As such, we hide the regular time of 13.5 (adjusted-)seasonal minutes and instead represent a new time factoring in more opinions (beyond just following R"T and still keeping in line with the Geonic tradition):

{:.fakeListItem}
These minutes are not seasonal and instead based on a fixed measurement.

{:.fakeListItem}
The time measurement is as long as 27 minutes.<span class="footnote">Ben Ish Ḥai (vol. 1 VaYakhel 4 & vol. 2 Vayetzeh 1) & Ohr LeTzion (vol. 1 y.d. siman 10)</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
The result is supposed to represent an astronomical reality.

Based on all of these reasonings, Maran Ovadya ruled that the Ohr Hachaim calendar should list Motzaeh Shabbat as 30 minutes after sunset<span class="footnote">See Yehave Daat (vol. 7 siman 56) Yalkut Yosef (New Edition siman 293 page 715) and Ohr HaChaim calendar. See Zivchey Tzedek (vol. 2 y.d. siman 17 page 66 & vol. 3 siman 104 page 198).</span>. However, there is an issue on how to transport that to the other areas of the world, especially since the latter claim of astronomical reality is one of the things Maran was concerned about that. To resolve the issue, there are two approaches:

{:.fakeListItem}
The Amudeh Hora'ah calendar chose to interpret the astronomical reality as degrees that the sun is below the horizon (which on the spring equinox day in Israel will match 7.14º). In terms of fixed minutes after sunset, this time will vary based on both location (between 34-42 minutes in New York) and season<span class="footnote">Keep in mind we are not using "seasonal minutes", since those would mean that winter days will be shorter</span>. A 20 fixed-minute minimum is in place for lands like Panoma which are closer to the equator and as such would have a quicker nightfall than Israel.

{:.fakeListItem}
The Ohr Hachaim calendar sticks with the consistent fixed minutes logic, meaning the same minutes will be used irrespective of the astronomical difference between the two. To properly accommodate latitudinal astronomical differences, our default option is 40 minutes after sunset, based on a private ruling by Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz.

###### Rabenu Tam

Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l held very strongly that for Motzeh Shabbat and Yom Kippur one should be stringent and abstain from melacha and most Rabbinic decrees until 72 minutes after sunset.<span class="footnote">Yabia Omer (vol. 2 siman 21) and many other locations.</span> However, many other authorities held that this isn’t essential lehalacha since historically only extremely pious individuals waited this long to take out the Shabbat.<span class="footnote">See Ohr LeTzion (vol. 4 chapter 20 footnote 2) & opinions mentioned in the footnote for Motzaeh Shabbat.</span> Nevertheless, the time is listed in this calendar, to afford those that wish to be strict that information. Based on the halachic rulings of the Yalkut Yosef and Halacha Berurah the 72 minutes are calculated in <b>the lesser</b> of two formats: 72 fixed minutes or 72 seasonal minutes.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 19), Yalkut Yosef (New Edition siman 293 page 724). Yode’eh Binah (chapter 7 law 6).</span>

###### Molad (New Moon)

The Molad (birth) of the new moon occurs at a specific time every lunar month where the moon "reappears" after it's dissappearance. The Talmud in Tractate Rosh Hashanah describes extensively how the Sanhedrin would interview the witnesses who saw the new moon and testified that it had occurred (on that day or the night before); that is, they would announce that Rosh Ḥodesh was that day had the witnesses been proven to report truthfully. In the event that no witnesses came to testify, Rosh Ḥodesh would be announced for the following day.

With our absence of a Sanhedrin, Hillel the 2<sup>nd</sup> established a formula to calculate the molad's for the foreseeable future until we have a Sanhedrin again. This formula is what all jewish calendars use today to determine the dates of the months.

The Molad is usually (in terms of Halacha) calculated as hours and Ḥalakim (where each Ḥelek is an 18<sup>th</sup> of a minute, making up 1080 Ḥalakim in an hour). These are calculated using Har Habayit's local time, which factors in its own timezone<span class="footnote">The Israeli Standard/Daylight Timezone is centered to encompass Israel as a whole. However, timezones themselves are a recent creation dating back only a little over one hundred years ago, and is not reflective of the time of Har Habait themselves. As such, the average of Ḥatzot times on Har Habait is not 12:00 exactly but rather 11:39.</span>, which then happens at that moment everywhere else in the world<span class="footnote">Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin z”l (Edut LeYisrael page 146b letter 15) and many many more. See Amude Horaah (vol. 4 Biur Horaah siman 428).</span> (factoring in that, say, a molad on Sunday at 1:06 AM IST in Israel would be on Saturday night at 6:06 PM EST in New York due to timezone adjustments).

The practice of Ashkenazic communities (as well as some Sepharadic ones) is to announce the result of this formula during Birkat HaḤodesh. However, we omit this information in our calendar due to it not being part of the normative Sepharadic custom<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 258)</span>. Communities looking to continue their tradition of announcing it should be careful to not follow the misleading ways that, in addition to not doing the proper adaptions (see paragraph above), fail to add the hours to the mean-sunset time<span class="footnote">Rabbi Yonah Martzabach z"l in sefer Aleh Yonah (page 35) who rejects Rav Tikuchinsky z"l's viewpoint (Ben HaShmashot page 102) to consider night in this regard as 6 fixed hours after midday of the prior day in any given time of the year.</span> and instead apply the time from the arbitrary "12:00 AM". Instead, they should add the hours and Ḥalakim from 5:39 PM IST, ensuring that daylight savings is not used.

###### Birkath HaLevana

Although the earliest time to recite Birkath HaLevana is <i>three</i> complete days after the calculated molad<span class="footnote">See Mishnah Berurah (siman 426 letter 20).</span>, it is preferable (if possible, and wouldn't lead you to lose out on the Beracha<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 363). See, Kaf HaChaim (426 62) & Ohr LeTzion (vol. 3 chapter 4 law 6) who disagree with this leniency.</span>) to wait <i>seven</i> days instead, as per our Sepharadic tradition.<span class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch (siman 426 law 4).</span>

The latest time to recite Birkat HaLevana according to Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l is the end of the night of the fifteenth of the Jewish month.<span class="footnote">Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 349). See next footnote. It is important to note that here we would certainly go based on each locations respective time since this measure is not fixated on the molad rather on the date itself.</span> Initially, one should try to recite the bracha even before that at the calculated halfway point of the month as the Rama writes in Siman 426 (halacha 3).<span class="footnote">Ruling of Maran HaRav Ovadya Yosef Zt”l pertaining to calendar Ohr HaChaim. Especially in light of the opinions that there is a question of beracha levatalah after this time (see Rav Pealim vol. 2 siman 38, Kaf HaChaim 426:50 & 53, Ohr LeTzion vol. 3 chapter 4 law 6).</span>

###### Tekufa

Tekufot are the Halachic equivalents of the yearly solar seasons, which we have four of yearly; Nissan/Spring, Tamuz/Summer, Tishri/Fall & Tevet/Winter. There are two practical concepts that depend on when the beginning<span class="footnote">רש”י על שמות ל”ד:כ”ב - “שֶׁהִיא בַחֲזָרַת - בִּתְחִלַּת”</span> of each Tekufa falls out:

{:.fakeListItem}
Outside ארץ ישראל, we switch the text of תפילת שמונה עשרי from ברכנו to ברך עלינו after 60 days into Tekufat Tishri<span class="footnote">ש”ע או”ח קי”ז:י”א</span>. Although this currently corresponds to December 4<sup>th</sup> (or December 5<sup>th</sup>), this will drift outside of those days as the years go.

{:.fakeListItem}
There is a custom that developed not to drink plain water at the beginning of the Tekufah itself<span class="footnote">רמ”א על יורה דעה קט”ז:ה</span>. Beyond those who follow this for the simple reason of starting off the Tekufah with something important<span class="footnote">תשובות הגאונים (מוסאפיה) סי’ י”ד</span> (for the sake of having a "rare event" to capture people's attention), the concept is stressed in a stronger fashion among Kabbalistic circles, warning of the spiritual danger that befalls during this time <span class="footnote">פרי חדש על ש”ע או”ח סוף סימן תכ”ח מזהיר על חשש המוות</span>. As such, some took an additional “time-buffer” before and after the time. Although they range from 15 minutes<span class="footnote">חיד”א, שו”ת יוסף אומץ סימן מ”ב</span> to 3 hours <span class="footnote">מנהגי מהרי”ל בליקוטים של סימן נו</span>, the common customs have been to wait either an hour and a half prior and following<span class="footnote">Rabbi Mazuz on Djerban Minhagim; רמ”ך בברית כהונה - חלק אורח חיים מערכת ת’ אותיות כ”א-כ”ה</span>, or half an hour prior and following<span class="footnote">נהר מצרים, דף עז ע”ב; ר’ אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט”ז אות ה</span>. Maran Ovadya concludes like the latter of the two, as recorded in Halichot Olam (vol. VII, pg. 183).

----

To know which date a תקופה will fall out on, one must have a point of reference when a known תקופה was. The easiest known תקופה is the one recorded in משנה תורה, הלכות קידוש החדש (9:4), due to it being the first תקופה of the world. From there, you’ll need to add the length of a season, which is as simple as taking the length of a year divided by four.

{:.fakeListItem}
We hold like שמואל (Bavli Eruvin, 56a) that a year is 365.25 days. Thereby, dividing that into four gives us the season’s length of 91 days, 7 hours and 30 minutes. This rounded value of 365.25 is used for the sake of being easier to keep track of (Hazon Ish - OC Siman 138, se’if katan 4).

{:.fakeListItem}
A further debate is whether these Tekufot used a fixed clock time of 12:00 PM or used local Israel Ḥatzot. Although the Ohr Hachaim calendar uses the fixed clock time like Rav Tuchanski does in his calendar, the תנובות שדה (Rav Aharon Boron) takes issue with this due to the arbitrary nature of a 12:00 midpoint. As such, the עמודי הוראה calendar (as well with the unofficial לוח ילקוט יוסף) uses the local Israel Ḥatzot time of 11:39 AM, which is only a -21 minute difference. For the water warning above, it is possible to accomodate both by starting the time period with R Boron’s time and finishing by the time listed in the Ohr Hachaim calendar.
