The Talmud's expectation<span class="footnote">Examples of how they are expected are found in the commentaries to Berakhoth 9b-10b, on two separate cases: The reason why Ḥizkiyahu's Tefila was praised & what קהלא קדישה guarantee'd a harm-free day for. Specifically, the condition is if they conjoin "Geula" (the last Beracha of the Shema) and Tefila (the Amida). The Maharsha/Tosafot point out (respectively) its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time</span> of one's morning is that they should awaken the dawn<span class="footnote">Tur, 1:1 based on Yehuda Ben Tema’s statement (Avoth 5:2) of גבור כארי</span> and pray תפילת שחרית by הנץ החמה, which is its codified time.<span class="footnote">MT, Laws of Tefila & the Priestly Blessing, 3:1</span> Many of our leader-figures were found to follow these instuctions, such as Avraham,<span class="footnote">Parashat Vayikra, by the Aqeda</span> David Hamelekh<span class="footnote">Tehilim 58:9</span>, & Ḥizkiyahu.<span class="footnote">see footnote 1</span> There are even specific laws applying to those who pray this time consistently, including potentially praying independently to not break the routine.

There are many discussions surrounding prayer by this time; specifically, its importance and the blessings given to those compliant.<span class="footnote">This list is an adaptation from its Hebrew variant in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition), Oraḥ Ḥayim II, pg. 458.</span>

Rabbi Eliezer's criticizm on those who "fixate their Tefila" is that their Tefilot do not constitute as "pleading"/תַּחֲנוּנִים (meaning there is a problem with it). Both Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin clarify it to be discussing those that do not pray with "the reddening of the sun" [by sunrise].<span class="footnote">פירוש הגמרה (ברכות כט:) על משנה ברכות ד:ג</span><br>
The Gemara immediately follows up with a counter-argument; the Sages of the West [Israel] were against the practice!<span class="footnote">The "expectation" set above is not negated because of this argument; not only is it inapplicable, but it's still within the law to pray at a time later than sunrise, since sunrise is only "מצוה מן המובכר". As such, Yeshiva Bachurim who would have their learning disturbed by their early rising do not need to subject themselves to this prayer times and can certainly use the later ones. (Yalkut Yosef 2021 Edition, siman 89)</span> However, their concern of "mixing up the time" is not revelant (according to our דרך פסק), since even according to our opinion that sunset is not necessarily an Halachic range, there is padding around the actual time itself (two minutes), as we'll discuss in the relevant paragraph.

There is a special Kabbalistic protection from prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the jews/the world, whether it's Hashem's vouching on our behalf<span class="footnote">בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness being revealed by Hashem's mercy.<span class="footnote">בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span> In these cases, it was the people that prayed by sunrise that involked the counterattack, like the power behind "וישכם אברהם בבוקר" ("and Avraham arose early in the morning").
