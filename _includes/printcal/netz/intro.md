Specifically, the condition is the conjuction of "גאולה" (the last blessing of the Shema) and Tefila (the Amida). The Maharsha/Tosafot point out (respectively) its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time.

There are many discussions surrounding prayer by this time; specifically, its importance and the blessings given to those compliant.<span class="footnote">This list (safe for the last item) is an adaptation from its Hebrew variant in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition), Oraḥ Ḥayim II, pg. 458.</span>

As explained by Abaye bar Avin & Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin, those who don't pray with "the reddening of the sun" are fixating their prayers, making it lack "supplications"/תחנונים.<span class="footnote">פירוש הגמרה (ברכות כט:) על ביקורת של רבי אליעזר (משנה ברכות ד:ג)<br>It is in this detail that the Sages of the West [Israel] rise to voice their disapproval of the practice (praying by the "reddening of the sun", which would apply to הנץ החמה in addition to מנחה), concerning themselves with the possibility of mixing up the time. Nonetheless, we are not concerned for this; even setting aside that the context cannot be talking about שחרית (since one has a range of time that is considered תפילה בהנץ החמה, irrespective of our fixed definition of הנץ החמה not including the ספק השיטות, as we'll discuss later), we use a ספק ספיקה to permit praying during the Geonic night-twilight (Maybe the law goes like the other authorities that permit מנחה until Nightfall, and maybe it's still day - either based on the nature of twilight or the law potentially following RT for the length of the day), prior to the Geonic Nightfall. Even if the end-time of מנחה was sunset, it would still be irrelevant to שחרית considering the potential question of סב"ל is disputed by the fact that one can pray before הנץ החמה; it would just be a question of בדיעבד or לחתחילה<br>A possible proof to the argument above is from the Ari z"l's practice of praying all three daily prayers as the sun reddens. Nevertheless, this is only consistent with his opinion that follows רבינו תם by night time, since the problem only arises long after the time of sunset (which by then he has prayed both מנחה וערבית)</span>

There is a special Kabbalistic protection from prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the jews/the world, whether it's Hashem's vouching on our behalf<span class="footnote">בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness being revealed by Hashem's mercy.<span class="footnote">בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span> In these cases, it was the people that prayed by sunrise that involked the counterattack, like the power behind "וישכם אברהם בבוקר" ("and Avraham arose early in the morning").

The time of עת רצון is found during the last 4 hours of the night, prior to the rising of Dawn.<span class="footnote">י"י מהדורה תשע"ו אמוד מה</span> Customs thereby developed to either sing Baqashot (on Shabbat) or read Seliḥot (during the month of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה)<span class="footnote">משנה תורה הלכות תשובה ג:ד, שו"ע או"ח תקפא:א</span>, taking advantage of its unique property until it was time for תפילה בהנץ החמה (which, through extension, they would already be awake for).

The communal custom (based on relevant authorities) is to prioritize certain days over others for praying by sunrise<span class="footnote">On these other days, those not praying by sunrise would pray before the 4<sup>th</sup> hour, using times provided by our grander calendar found at royzmanim.com. Although prayer by sunrise is an expectation, it is not an obligation and one should not compromise on their learning to follow said expectation (י"י (מהדורה תשפ"א) סימן פט). One of the people this applied to was Maran zt"l himself (ארחות מרן ז:ד)</span>, each with its own unique attributes. One of the lists is labeled under the acronym of "אברהם"<span class="footnote">חידא, דבש לפי ה:ו; כף החיים פלאגי לא:ס</span>, derived from the verse וישכם אברהם בבוקר:

<br>In Ḥakham Ovadia's practical world, this list was even simpler, as only the days that had overnight learning would be the ones that community focused on for תפילה בהנץ (which limits our list to only <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">שבועות</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע יו"ט שט</span> & <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">הושענא רבה</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע סוכות עמוד תלח</span>); the exception to that would be an added day of <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">תקופת החמה</span>.<span class="footnote">This is a custom name we gave to the Tekufa which would contain ברכת החמה; one would avoid water during that one hour period (as explained later), wait until the next morning to wake up and pray by הנץ החמה to say this ברכה as soon as possible.
