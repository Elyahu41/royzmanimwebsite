The three words of ייראוך עם-שמש<span class="footnote">תהילים עב:ה</span> have defined the natural expected morning routine of every Jew,<span class="footnote">The Ramban's use of the verse ועמך <i>כולם</i> צדיקים <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">(<span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">מלחמת השם על דפי הריף ח:-ט.</span>)</span> equates the word צדיקים with ותיקין. Rashi (ברכות בבלי כו) explains that word as המקדימין למצות ומחזרים לעשות דבר בזמנו ומצותו.</span> by awakening the dawn,<span class="footnote">טור א:א, לפי מאמר מיהודה בן תימא (אבות ה:ב) של "גבור כארי"</span> reading קריאת שמע right next to sunrise<span class="footnote">בריתא, ברכות בבלי כו</span> and finally conclude the Dawn services with תפילת שחרית at the moment of sunrise.<span class="footnote">This "expectation" is expressed through commentaries to <span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">ברכות בבלי ט:-י:</span> for two separate cases: The praise for Ḥizkiyahu's Tefila & what קהלא קדישה guarantee'd a harm-free day for. Specifically, the condition is the conjuction of "גאולה" (the last blessing of the Shema) and Tefila (the Amida). The Maharsha/Tosafot point out (respectively) its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time. This expectation was then explicitly codified (רמב"ם הלכות תפילה וברכת כהנים, ג:א)</span> Kabbalistically, this routine is essential to the upholding of the world itself, as it defends (either through testimony<span class="footnote">בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness revealed by Hashem's mercy<span class="footnote">בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span>) against the prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the Jewish people. People who maintained the expectation (including our forefather Avraham<span class="footnote">Parashat Vayera, by the Aqeda</span> and kings such as David<span class="footnote">תהילים נח:ט</span> & Ḥizkiyahu<span class="footnote">see footnote 5</span>) involke personal merit too,<span class="footnote">Although we've sprinkled each of the elements throughout the entirety of this introduction (in both the main text & footnotes), they're only adaptations from the original Hebrew variant, found in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition), Oraḥ Ḥayim II, pg. 458.</span> including fear of heaven throughout the day.<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">ברכות ירושלמי כז.</span></span>

Local Sepharadic customs nowadays (of Baqashot on Shabbat or Seliḥot during the month of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה)<span class="footnote">משנה תורה הלכות תשובה ג:ד, שו"ע או"ח תקפא:א</span> conveniently surround this time, allowing one to take advantage of the extra benefits of praying at the time of עת רצון, found in the last four hours of the night.<span class="footnote">י"י מהדורה תשע"ו אמוד מה</span> Nevertheless, the communal custom (based on relevant authorities) is to prioritize certain days over others for praying by sunrise<span class="footnote">On these other days, those not praying by sunrise would pray before the 4<sup>th</sup> hour, using times provided by our grander calendar found at royzmanim.com. Although prayer by sunrise is an expectation, it is not an obligation and one should not compromise on their learning to follow said expectation, as explained in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition, Siman 89). One of the people this applied to was Maran zt"l himself (ארחות מרן ז:ד)</span>, each with its own unique attributes. One of the lists is labeled under the acronym of "אברהם"<span class="footnote">חידא, דבש לפי ה:ו; כף החיים פלאגי לא:ס</span>, derived from the verse וישכם אברהם בבוקר:

{:.customBulletList #bulletA}
יכה - The text we'd read on *9 Av*

{:.customBulletList #bulletB}
רשית של מתן תורה - The holiday of Shavu'ot, (whether just the first night or also the 2<sup>nd</sup> night when applicable)<span class="footnote">בא"ח במדבר ז, כף החיים תצד:ו</span>

{:.customBulletList #bulletR}
אש השנה<span class="footnote">בא"ח שנה ראשונה פרשת ניצבים יא; כף החיים תקפ"ג טל</span>

{:.customBulletList #bulletH}
ושענא רבה

{:.customBulletListFinale #bulletM}
גילה - The text we'd read on *Purim*

In Ḥakham Ovadia's practical world, this list was even simpler, as only the days that had overnight learning would be the ones that community focused on for תפילה בהנץ (which limits our list to only <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">שבועות</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע יו"ט שט</span> & <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">הושענא רבה</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע סוכות עמוד תלח</span>); the exception to that would be an added day of <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">תקופת החמה</span>.<span class="footnote">This is a custom name we gave to the Tekufa which would contain ברכת החמה; one would avoid water during that one hour period (as explained later), wait until the next morning to wake up and pray by הנץ החמה to say this ברכה as soon as possible. See חז"ע ברכות אמוד תעט for more information.</span>

(Other customs include Erev Rosh Hashana<span class="footnote">מאמר מרדכי לד:ה</span>, Yom Kippur<span class="footnote">ליקוטי מהרי"ח<br>Incidentally, this can also be derived by using our אברהם banner, since the list repositions every element (except for Shavu'ot, which isn't present). The primary version of this list is presented in ס"ת form (הושענ<b>א</b> [רבה], תשעה בא<b>ב</b>, יום קיפו<b>ר</b>, ראש השנ<b>ה</b> & פורי<b>ם</b>), utilizing the last letter of the holiday names. For something closer to the Ḥida's list (utilizing objects of the holiday, traditional first-letter acronyms), a secondary version is presented in this fashion: <b>א</b>סתר, <b>ב</b>היות הבוקר (תשעה באב), <b>ר</b>אש השנה, <b>ה</b>ושענא רבה & <b>מ</b>חילת עבונות</span> & 11 Tishri<span class="footnote">Insert Pinny Citation</span>)

With all that being said, those who don't pray with "the reddening of the sun" are fixating their prayers, making it lack "supplications"/תחנונים.<span class="footnote">פירוש הגמרה של אביי בר אבין ורבי חנינא בר אבין (ברכות כט:) על ביקורת של רבי אליעזר (משנה ברכות ד:ג)<br>It is in this detail that the Sages of the West [Israel] rise to voice their disapproval of the practice (praying by the "reddening of the sun", which would apply to הנץ החמה in addition to מנחה), concerning themselves with the possibility of mixing up the time. Nonetheless, we are not concerned for this; even setting aside that the context cannot be talking about שחרית (since one has a range of time that is considered תפילה בהנץ החמה, irrespective of our fixed definition of הנץ החמה not including the ספק השיטות, as we'll discuss later), we use a ספק ספיקה to permit praying during the Geonic night-twilight (Maybe the law goes like the other authorities that permit מנחה until Nightfall, and maybe it's still day - either based on the nature of twilight or the law potentially following RT for the length of the day), prior to the Geonic Nightfall. Even if the end-time of מנחה was sunset, it would still be irrelevant to שחרית considering the potential question of סב"ל is disputed by the fact that one can pray before הנץ החמה; it would just be a question of בדיעבד or לחתחילה<br>A possible proof to the argument above is from the Ari z"l's practice of praying all three daily prayers as the sun reddens. Nevertheless, this is only consistent with his opinion that follows רבינו תם by night time, since the problem only arises long after the time of sunset (which by then he has prayed both מנחה וערבית)</span> As such, it is worthy to continue the custom wherever possible.
