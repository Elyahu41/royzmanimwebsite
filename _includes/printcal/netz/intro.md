A Jew's morning in its ideal expected state (including in general being scrupulous in fulfillment of the commandments<span class="footnote">לותיקין – המקדימין למצות ומחזרים לעשות דבר בזמנו ומצותו (ברכות בבלי כו)</span>) is that they awaken the dawn<span class="footnote">Tur, 1:1 based on Yehuda Ben Tema’s statement (Avoth 5:2) of גבור כארי</span>, read קריאת שמע right next to sunrise<span class="footnote">בריתא, ברכות בבלי כו</span> and follow it with תפילת שחרית,<span class="footnote">The "expectation" isn't said explicitly, but commentaries to Berakhoth 9b-10b highlight this implicit reference on two separate cases: The reason why Ḥizkiyahu's Tefila was praised & what קהלא קדישה guarantee'd a harm-free day for. Specifically, the condition is if they conjoin "Geula" (the last Beracha of the Shema) and Tefila (the Amida). The Maharsha/Tosafot point out (respectively) its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time. This expectation was then explicitly codified (MT, Laws of Tefila & the Priestly Blessing, 3:1)</span> as it is said "ועמך כולם צדיקים".<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ן מלחמת השם על דפי הריף ח:-ט.</span></span> Many of our leader-figures were found to follow this practice, such as our forefathers (Avraham<span class="footnote">Parashat Vayera, by the Aqeda</span>) & Kings (David<span class="footnote">Tehilim 58:9</span> & Ḥizkiyahu<span class="footnote">see footnote 4</span>). During later years, customs developed to either sing Baqashot (on Shabbat) or read Seliḥot (during the month of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה)<span class="footnote">משנה תורה הלכות תשובה ג:ד, שו"ע או"ח תקפא:א</span> until it was time to pray.

There are many discussions surrounding prayer by this time; specifically, its importance and the blessings given to those compliant.<span class="footnote">This list (safe for the last item) is an adaptation from its Hebrew variant in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition), Oraḥ Ḥayim II, pg. 458.</span>

Those who pray by this time invoke fear of heaven throughout the day<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">ברכות ירושלמי כז.</span></span>

Rabbi Eliezer's criticizm on those who "fixate their prayer" is that their prayer isn't constituted as "pleading"/תחנונים (meaning there is a problem with it). Both Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin clarify that statement to be discussing those that do not pray with "the reddening of the sun" [by sunrise].<span class="footnote">פירוש הגמרה (ברכות כט:) על משנה ברכות ד:ג</span><br>
The Gemara immediately follows up with a counter-argument; the Sages of the West [Israel] were against the practice! However, their concern of "mixing up the time" is not revelant (according to our דרך פסק), since even according to our opinion that sunset is not necessarily an Halachic range, there is padding around the actual time itself (two minutes), as we'll discuss in the relevant paragraph.

There is a special Kabbalistic protection from prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the jews/the world, whether it's Hashem's vouching on our behalf<span class="footnote">בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness being revealed by Hashem's mercy.<span class="footnote">בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span> In these cases, it was the people that prayed by sunrise that involked the counterattack, like the power behind "וישכם אברהם בבוקר" ("and Avraham arose early in the morning").

The time of עת רצון is found during the last 4 hours of the night. Therefore, when it is the season to say Seliḥot (months of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה), these hours of אשמורת הבוקר are the most preferred for Seliḥot.<span class="footnote">י"י מהדורה תשע"ו אמוד מה</span> One could then immediately follow it with תפילה בנץ.

When people join their community to pray by הנץ החמה as a custom, it is not the time itself that has the custom (in most instances);<span class="footnote">Many did <i>not</i> adopt תפילת בנץ as a daily routine, among them being HaRav Ovadia Yosef zt"l (as recorded in Orḥot Maran 7:4)</span> rather, they are usually awake by עלות השחר anyway, regardless of whether it was planned as such or they were just awake overnight. However, each community has its own customs on when this would occur, with ours being as such:

{:.fakeListItem}
Shavu'ot, after staying up all night<span class="footnote">חז"ע יו"ט שט</span> (whether just the first night or also the second night when applicable)<span class="footnote">בא"ח במדבר ז, כף החיים תצד:ו</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
The day where one would get a chance to say ברכת החמה<span class="footnote">חז"ע ברכות אמוד תעט</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
Hoshana Rabba<span class="footnote">חז"ע סוכות אמוד תלח</span>

(Other customs include Erev Rosh Hashana<span class="footnote">מאמר מרדכי לד:ה</span>, Rosh Hashana<span class="footnote">בא"ח שנה ראשונה פרשת ניצבים יא; כף החיים תקפ"ג טל</span> & 11 Tishri)

However, this is something applicable to every day (as long as it wouldn't come at the expense of learning<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורה תשפ"א) סימן פט</span>), even to the point of having rules apply specifically to one who prays at these minyanim in routine.
