A Jew's morning in its ideal expected state (including in general being scrupulous in fulfillment of the commandments<span class="footnote">לותיקין – המקדימין למצות ומחזרים לעשות דבר בזמנו ומצותו (ברכות בבלי כו)</span>) is that they awaken the dawn<span class="footnote">טור א:א, לפי מאמר מיהודה בן תימא (אבות ה:ב) של "גבור כארי"</span>, read קריאת שמע right next to sunrise<span class="footnote">בריתא, ברכות בבלי כו</span> and follow it with תפילת שחרית.<span class="footnote">The "expectation" isn't said explicitly, but commentaries to Berakhoth 9b-10b highlight this implicit reference on two separate cases: The reason why Ḥizkiyahu's Tefila was praised & what קהלא קדישה guarantee'd a harm-free day for. Specifically, the condition is if they conjoin "Geula" (the last Beracha of the Shema) and Tefila (the Amida). The Maharsha/Tosafot point out (respectively) its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time. This expectation was then explicitly codified (MT, Laws of Tefila & the Priestly Blessing, 3:1)</span> Many of our leader-figures were found to follow this practice, such as our forefathers (Avraham<span class="footnote">Parashat Vayera, by the Aqeda</span>) & Kings (David<span class="footnote">תהילים נח:ט</span> & Ḥizkiyahu<span class="footnote">see footnote 4</span>). During later years, customs developed to either sing Baqashot (on Shabbat) or read Seliḥot (during the month of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה)<span class="footnote">משנה תורה הלכות תשובה ג:ד, שו"ע או"ח תקפא:א</span> until it was time to pray.

There are many discussions surrounding prayer by this time; specifically, its importance and the blessings given to those compliant.<span class="footnote">This list (safe for the last item) is an adaptation from its Hebrew variant in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition), Oraḥ Ḥayim II, pg. 458.</span>

Those who pray by this time invoke fear of heaven throughout the day<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">ברכות ירושלמי כז.</span></span>

Rabbi Eliezer's criticizm on those who "fixate their prayer" is that their prayer isn't constituted as "pleading"/תחנונים (meaning there is a problem with it). Both Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin clarify that statement to be discussing those that do not pray with "the reddening of the sun" [by sunrise].<span class="footnote">פירוש הגמרה (ברכות כט:) על משנה ברכות ד:ג</span><br>
The Gemara immediately follows up with a counter-argument; the Sages of the West [Israel] were against the practice! However, their concern of "mixing up the time" is not revelant (according to our דרך פסק), since even according to our opinion that sunset is not necessarily an Halachic range, there is padding around the actual time itself (two minutes), as we'll discuss in the relevant paragraph.

There is a special Kabbalistic protection from prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the jews/the world, whether it's Hashem's vouching on our behalf<span class="footnote">בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness being revealed by Hashem's mercy.<span class="footnote">בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span> In these cases, it was the people that prayed by sunrise that involked the counterattack, like the power behind "וישכם אברהם בבוקר" ("and Avraham arose early in the morning").

The time of עת רצון is found during the last 4 hours of the night. Therefore, when it is the season to say Seliḥot (months of Elul & עשרת ימי תשובה), these hours of אשמורת הבוקר are the most preferred for Seliḥot.<span class="footnote">י"י מהדורה תשע"ו אמוד מה</span> One could then immediately follow it with תפילה בנץ.

Although communities as a whole did not institute prayer by sunrise as a daily routine<span class="footnote">Many did <i>not</i> adopt תפילת בנץ as a daily routine, among them being HaRav Ovadia Yosef zt"l (as recorded in Orḥot Maran 7:4)</span>, there were certain days where authorities considered it better to pray by sunrise over others. Arguably one of the easiest to remember is the list of "אברהם"<span class="footnote">חידא, דבש לפי ה:ו; כף החיים פלאגי לא:ס</span>, derived from the verse וישכם אברהם בבוקר:

{:.customBulletList #bulletA}
יכה - The text we'd read on *9 Av*

{:.customBulletList #bulletB}
רשית של מתן תורה - The holiday of Shavu'ot, (whether just the first night or also the 2<sup>nd</sup> night when applicable)<span class="footnote">בא"ח במדבר ז, כף החיים תצד:ו</span>

{:.customBulletList #bulletR}
אש השנה<span class="footnote">בא"ח שנה ראשונה פרשת ניצבים יא; כף החיים תקפ"ג טל</span>

{:.customBulletList #bulletH}
ושענא רבה

{:.customBulletList #bulletM}
גילה - The text we'd read on *Purim*

<br>In Ḥakham Ovadia's practical world, this list was even simpler, as only the days that had overnight learning would be the ones that community focused on for תפילה בהנץ (which limits our list to only <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">שבועות</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע יו"ט שט</span> & <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">הושענא רבה</span><span class="footnote">חז"ע סוכות עמוד תלח</span>); the exception to that would be an added day of <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">תקופת החמה</span>.<span class="footnote">This is a custom name we gave to the Tekufa which would contain ברכת החמה; one would avoid water during that one hour period (as explained later), wait until the next morning to wake up and pray by הנץ החמה to say this ברכה as soon as possible. See חז"ע ברכות אמוד תעט for more information.</span>

(Other customs include Erev Rosh Hashana<span class="footnote">מאמר מרדכי לד:ה</span>, Yom Kippur<span class="footnote">ליקוטי מהרי"ח<br>Incidentally, this can also be derived by using our אברהם banner, since the list repositions every element (except for Shavu'ot, which isn't present). The primary version of this list is presented in ס"ת form (הושענ<b>א</b> [רבה], תשעה בא<b>ב</b>, יום קיפו<b>ר</b>, ראש השנ<b>ה</b> & פורי<b>ם</b>), utilizing the last letter of the holiday names. For something closer to the Ḥida's list (utilizing objects of the holiday, traditional first-letter acronyms), a secondary version is presented in this fashion: <b>א</b>סתר, <b>ב</b>היות הבוקר (תשעה באב), <b>ר</b>אש השנה, <b>ה</b>ושענא רבה & <b>מ</b>חילת עבונות</span> & 11 Tishri<span class="footnote">Insert Pinny Citation</span>)

Nevertheless, this practice is certainly applicable to every day (as long as it won't affect one's ability to learn<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורה תשפ"א) סימן פט</span>), especially for those who are part of Hashem's עם, full of צדיקים (which in our context means ותיקין, which praying by הנץ החמה is fitting for)<span class="footnote"><span style="unicode-bidi: plaintext;">רמב"ן מלחמת השם על דפי הריף ח:-ט.</span></span>
