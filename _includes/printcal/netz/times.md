###### Dawn

Dawn begins the halachic day, which happens as the sun's rays are visible in the lit-up Eastern part of the sky.<span class="footnote">רא"ש, ברכות ד:א; רמב"ם פירוש המשניות ד:א; ש"ע א"ח פט:א</span> In Hebrew, this time is either called <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עלות השחר</span><span class="footnote">Genesis 32:25. Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15</span> or <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עמוד השחר</span>.<span class="footnote">משנה ברכות א:א</span> Practically, the new day's obligations start from this time (such as not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even though active-commands should be delayed until sunrise when one is not in an pressing circumstance (although one who erroniously did it before sunrise is exempt post-facto). This also means that the night's commandments are no longer performable, such as Tiqqun Ḥaṣoth, Qeriath Shema (when not obmitted due to negligence) and the evening prayer.

For the Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> to determine how long this period of twilight lasts (which Dawn happens at the very beginning of), the day's length (of 40 _mil_<span class="footnote">A mil is the distance of 2000 *Amot*. This is determined by basic math; S"A O"Ḥ 261:2 says that 75% (3&frasl;4) of a mil is 1500 amot</span>/10 *parasangs* of space converted to the amount of time it would take the average person to walk said space) is used as a reference. Whether subtracting the twilight periods<span class="footnote">A period of twilight also happens after sunset, concluding after the same length of our twilight with the astronomical phenomenon of "צאת כל הכוכבים". (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) Both periods of twilight are used to determine the halachic time of Dawn, even though the other twilight bears no practical bearing on our Halachic timeframe.<br>R"T asserts that the parallels in our Gemara <i>holds</i> practical weight for the post-sunset twilight by recontextualizing the "conflicting Gemara" (Shabbat Bavli, 34b) as referring to a 2<sup>nd</sup> sunset. The בין השמשות (time of doubt whether its day or night, lasting 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil) following this sunset was then parraleled by the Ḥatam Sofer (commentary on S"A O"Ḥ 89, MG"A 2) for our Dawn purposes, where Dawn now starts a time period of doubt rather than be certain day. This time period of doubt would then finally be concluded by day, determined by "האיר פני המזרח" (effectively giving a new definition to our עלות השחר. Although the Ḥ"S himself doesn't say this, the Yalkut Yosef (5781 Edition, pg 464) learns as such based on the <i>Mishna Berura</i> (89:2) distinguishing between "שיאיר פני כל המזרח" and "שהבריק השחר כנקודה בלבד"). Nevertheless, both the premise law and the extrapolated law contradict our tradition of there being no resemblence in the conclusion of the "Talmudic contradiction" between the times post-sunset and pre-dawn, instead giving clear singular definitions to both Dawn and sunset. The </span> length from the 40 or adding them onto the 40,<span class="footnote">Although this debate (between the Bet Yosef saying the reserved <i>mil</i> is part of the 40 vs the GR"A saying that they're additional <i>mil</i>) is very important to determine which seasonal hours to use throughout the day, we have neglected to mention it here since a seasonal hour dependent on dawn could not be used to determine when dawn would be, making it irrelevant for our purposes of explaining Dawn.</span> the primary matter of debate is how many of these mil are the ones reserved for twilight; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**.

The Talmud's methodology through an authoritative eye would mean contextualizing and reinterpreting the above as needed.<span class="footnote">It is important to note, though, that there are few Rabbis who codified this <i>sugya</i> that did <b>not</b> contextualize the concluded time, and instead applied the concluded time to each respective day and respective location.<br>ע"ע תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכןת ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפ"ח)</span> There are two factors that would determine a change to the time above:

1. The Gemara's context was referring to Erev Pesaḥ, which happens closer to the spring equinox day (March 20<sup>th</sup>, which is when the length of daytime and nightime are symmetrical). The days furthest away from the two equinoxes (such as June 20<sup>th</sup> & December 20<sup>th</sup>) features the biggest differences to the lengths of twilight and daylight.
2. Even after resolving the seasonal conflicts by limiting ourselves to just the equinox day, the length of astronomical twilight adjusts depending on how far one is from the equator (the Gemara was only talking about Eretz Yisrael, since that's where one would offer the Korban Pesaḥ). Thereby, minutes are just a correlation and one would need to find the causation itself and apply that to the respective location. Said causation is the position of the sun below the horizon, measurable in the form of degrees.

The Sepharadic custom has been to use "seasonal minutes" to accommodate the first factor, where the designated span of time for twilight is shortened/extended depending on the length of the day.<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסקים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span> Determining the initial timespan designation from the equinox day _could_ be done using the Talmudic conclusion of 72 minutes<span class="footnote">While R' Yitzḥak Yosef (עין יצחק ג' עמוד רל) does not explicitly argue against R' David Yosef's opinion (next line, main text), the words indicate there is no astronomical factor when it comes to determining the time of Dawn.</span>, yet the equivalence to the astronomical definition of dawn from the equinox day would only work in latitudes that match Israel's; locations at a further/closer distance from the equator would need to instead use the time-equivalent degree (of 16.04) applied on the spring equinox day.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104). Although R David writes one should only be stringent and increase, the logic of using it for leniencies by regular seasonal minutes also apply by these adjusted-seasonal minutes<br>This is <b>not</b> the typical application of degrees, as most calendars (including some from Sepharadic authorities; see the Kisse Raḥamim & Ahavat Shalom calendars) apply the degree to the location for that day itself, creating a consistent astronomical picture even in the winter time (where the astronomical truth does not reflect the halachic truth of seasonal minutes). Nevertheless, the difference between typical degree application and adjusted-seasonal minutes during the summer months is very minimal, and one would be able to use the times from those calendars (assuming the base of the degrees match our equinox-day times).</span> This "adjusted-seasonal" accommodations are labeled throughout our network as "Amudeh Hora'ah" mode, while the original seasonal behavior is deligated to the "Ohr Hachaim" mode.

_Any_ altercation (whether earlier or later) to the time of dawn will introduce both stringencies & leniencies, all depending heavily on a case-by-case basis, with various scenarios to cover. As such, to avoid being unreliably lenient,<span class="footnote">Leniencies provided by our methodology of seasonal time is not within this definition, as we rely on our sages's advice.<br>פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span> one should **not** depend on other methods that would provide more convenient times.<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעה סימן פט:יב</span> Workers that need to pray early (which they can do <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">לחתחילה</span><span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעד סימן פט:יא</span>) *could* start קרבנות after 90 [adjusted-]seasonal minutes before Dawn, use an earlier time to start saying Korbanot after a 90-minute Dawn opinion;<span class="footnote">See footnotes to the siman above, found on the next page<br>Although earlier editions of the YY (specifically, page 69 in the 5745 version) relied on the Yeḥave Da'at (vol. II siman 8) to utilize a 24-minute mil (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק") to permit even earlier times for Dawn (which would translate to 96 or 120 minutes), there is not a trace of it in the newest printing. Setting aside the fact that more opinions are fine with 90 minutes and the extra 18 minutes from 72 to 90 being plentiful already, the length of a mil must be compatible with the Gemara's reading of a day having 40 mil & the day's length (measured from Dawn until Nightfall; trying to make the day's length expand the mil externally [like the GR"A for the 18 minute mil] makes the day's length well break our boundary established in the next few words) of 720 minutes (12\*60).<br><br>Fitting the 24-minute mils within a 32-mil daylight period (24\*32) breaks the limit by 48 minutes. Thereby, the 96 minute Dawn (composed of 4 mil that would have been subtracted from the day's count of 40 mil) is not mathematically possible<br>Fitting the 24-minute mils within a 30-mil daylight period (24\*30) will sit comfortably for the time of daylight itself, yet will extend dawn by another 24 minutes (since we need to add one mil to both directions, making it 5 mil instead of 4) to a time that is 120 minutes before sunrise (which is almost double of our primary time - 72 minutes).<br><br>Due to being such a drastic change (with the added bonus of it not even working astronomically), we therefore forego the 24 minute mil altogether and use a smaller mil length (of 22.5 minutes) to get a 90 minute dawn by 4 mil, only not used on a typical basis because of our custom not doing that prior.<br>One attempted way to get at 90 minutes is to apply the GR"A's explanations on the Rambam (Biur HaGR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 459:2) in unsuitable fashions, cherry picking details to get a conclusion that neither the Rambam or the GR"A would hold. This means measuring the 40 mil of the day from sunrise until sunset (contradicting the only way to get to 24, as used in Pirush Mishnayot Pesaḥim, ibid) to then make the extra mil from the twilight times on top of the 40. These extra mil would be 5 mil instead of 4 (which although goes against our text of the Gemara, the GR"A says that perhaps the Rambam had a varient text supporting it. Nevertheless, that would only explain why he would use it by Pesaḥim; there's no reason for him to use it here, and in fact, he doesn't - Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Berachot 1:1 says explicitly 72 minutes, which is equivalent to 4 mil). Setting aside the technical details of authorities and variant texts, the GR"A's main point to the paper was to reconsile the two conflicting lengths of a mil; the Ḥidush used of additional mil, though, does not match what his explanation to Pesaḥim would have wanted. His commentary explicitly says there 15 mil between sunrise and midday, with a mirror for midday until sunset; 15 multiplied by 2 is 30, not 40.</span> one may **not** use this early time for ברוך שאמר onwards, though, due to the rule of ספק ברכות להקל.

###### Misheyakir

Due to a concern that one would sleep with their pair of Tefilin, the Rabbis issued a restriction on having Tefilin during the nightime<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:2</span>. Instead, one must wait for the time of **Misheyakir**, which is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet.<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:1</span>.
