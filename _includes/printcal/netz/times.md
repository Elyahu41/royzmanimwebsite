<h6>Dawn - <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עלות<span class="footnote">Genesis 32:25. Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15</span>/<span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עמוד</span><span class="footnote">משנה ברכות א:א</span> השחר</span></h6>

Dawn begins the halachic day, signified by the visibility of the sun's rays in the illuminated eastern sky.<span class="footnote">רא"ש, ברכות ד:א; רמב"ם פירוש המשניות ד:א; ש"ע א"ח פט:א</span> It's the moment that transitions from the night's commandments (examples: תיקון רחל,<span class="footnote">Not included in this rule is תיקון לאה, which could be said even after Dawn since it is only מזמורי תהילים. On the otherhand, the full seder of תיקון רחל should only be said prior to Dawn. (הליכות עולם א' פרשת וישלח הלכה ו; שו"ת איש מצליח חלק א סימן ד)<br>The permissibility to say תיקון רחל in the time surrounding Dawn is subject to great dispute. Concluding within the half hour prior to Dawn is permitted considering our ability to determine whether the Dawn has risen to the precise minute (negating the concern of רב פעלים חלק ב או"ח סעיף ב. This letter-of-the-law ruling was represented in בא"ח א וישלח הלכה ח). On the other hand, saying it after dawn is forbidden from the words of the Zohar (as repeated in משפת כתוב ס"א, quoted in י"י (מהדורא תשפ"א) א:מח (אמוד פא)), meaning one should not say it even during the time until Misheyakir (against שו"ת יצחק ירנן ח"א סי' כ"ז & responsa attributed to שו"ת איש מצליח by RYY).</span> קריאת שמע של ערבית & תפילת ערבית) to the days commandments (like not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even if not a full-proof perfect one. This is because there are cases where the night's commandments (קריאת שמע בלי ברכת השכיבנו) could still be done into the day, and practically, one should still not perform positive commandments (such as prayer) until sunrise (unless there is a pressing circumstance. Also, one who erroneously did any commndment before sunrise is exempt post-facto).

Although the definition of Dawn is based on astronomy, the Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> uses the length of the average day<span class="footnote">Each day is measured by it's length, making the average when the both the day and night span 12 hours. Rather than use our system of hours, we instead use space measurements, converted to the amount of time it takes to walk said space. Specifically, the measurements are 40 mil, with each mil being 2000 *Amot* long.<br>Sourcing involves math from S"A, which says (O"Ḥ 261:2) that 75% (3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s) of a singular mli is 1500 *Amot*</span> as a reference for how long the period of twilight following Dawn will be.<span class="footnote">Twilight is a time period that's used either within or in addition to (debate between the Bet Yosef & the GR"A, irrelevant for our discussion here even though it's relevant to defining a seasonal hour) the measurements of day, even though it's outside of the range from sunrise to sunset.<br>
The time period following sunset until "צאת כל הכוכבים" (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) is another period of twilight, as long as the morning's. However, the practicality of this later twilight from our text of the Gemara is to determine the morning's twilight length. The GR"A (ibid) negates any legal perspective for this second twilight, whereas R' Hai Gaon & R' Sherira Gaon suggests (Teshuvot Maharam Alashkar 96) that there was an initial legal outcome of the night's twilight, until R Yehuda himself revolked that by the time he concluded his ruling (Shabbat Bavli 34b).<br><br>
The third interpretation comes from Rabbenu Tam, who includes the legal time of "Ben Hashemashot" (time of doubt whether its day or night, lasting 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil) within the end of the night's twilight. With the basis of the assertion being that there is a parralel in the twilights in the legal world as well, the Ḥatam Sofer (commentary on S"A O"Ḥ 89, MG"A 2) adds onto the parralel's by introducing a "Ben Hashemashot" at the start of Dawn. Practically, this means the day's certain beginning only starts after Dawn, introducing a new time into the morning's routine. (One possible explanation is given by the Yalkut Yosef - 5781 Edition, pg 464, distinguishing between "שיאיר פני כל המזרח" and "שהבריק השחר כנקודה בלבד", based on the Mishna Berurah 89:2). Nevertheless, both the premise law and the extrapolated law contradict our tradition of there being no resemblence in the conclusion of the "Talmudic contradiction" between the times post-sunset and pre-dawn, instead giving clear singular definitions to both Dawn and sunset.</span> The length of these twilights are subject to debate; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**.

The codification of this law from our authorities views the context (Israel on Erev Pesaḥ<span class="footnote">This refers to the spring equinox, where the lnegth of day & night is symmetric to each other. Lengths of each are shortened/extended depending on how far one is from this day and it's fall counterpart on September 20<sup>th</sup>.</span>) as a means to create an astronomical parralel<span class="footnote">Specifically, the sun's position below the horizon, measurable at 16.04 degrees</span> to the passage of time; however, when the parameters change (such as the different days of the calendar or different locations than Israel), we maintain the time length of twilight would also accommodate.<span class="footnote">This is unlike those that codified the concluded time itself irrespective of the astronomical inconsistency, in the form of "fixed minutes". According to these opinions, 72 minutes would be the same 72 minutes throughout the whole year and the whole world. For further research, read the following:<br>תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכןת ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפח)</span>

Recreating the context of the Gemara is as easy as applying the sun's position ("degree") below the horizon on the equinox day at those minutes to the respective location.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104). Although R David writes one should only be stringent and increase, the logic of using it for leniencies by regular seasonal minutes also apply by these adjusted-seasonal minutes</span> One could then measure the time that this astronomical event takes place until sunrise to get the length of twilight fitting for that location.<span class="footnote">This position maintains that the length of twilight is location based, which takes the middle position of two extremes.<br>The first extreme is that there is no astronomical relevancy concerning this period of twilight. Although this is the opinion of R' Yitzḥak Yosef (עין יצחק ג' עמוד רל), the point of seasonal minutes is to conform with the astronomical reality, especially when his assertion is inconsistent with his opinion on the nighttime period of twilight (which he asserts <i>does</i> factor in astronomical norms). For our "Ohr Hachaim" mode, we've maintained consistency with seasonal minutes for both periods of twilight but we've used a fixed measurement of 72 minutes to be then made seasonal.<br>The second extreme is to only regard the positioning of the sun, without any consideration for the equinox day in the respective location. This is the typical application of degrees, adopted by even Sepharadic authorities such as R' Mazuz (in the Kisse Raḥamim calendar) & R' Ya'akov Hillel (in the Ahavat Shalom calendar). Nevertheless, this is not reflected in our calendar as it deviates from the traditional Sepharadic norm.<br></span> To fit it with the normative Sepharadic custom, this twilight period is then lengthened/shortened depending on how long the day itself lasts, in a process called "seasonal minutes".<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסכים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span>

The calendar times generated using our formula may result in either a leniency or a stringency, dependent on the scenario & the other time used in the comparsion. Due to the nature of how reliant we are on our time, *any* other formula that would generate more comfortable/lenient times may **not** be used to supersede our "stringencies", considering they use premises not adopted by our authorities.<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעה סימן פט:יב<br>Although the inverse is also true (that their authorities would not rely on our results), our authorities have held of our times even when it was visibly more lenient - פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span>. However, there are cases where we introduce further leniencies, whether due to an inaccessibility to our opinions or when our opinion is too stringent:

Those unable to pray תפילת שחרית from sunrise until the 4<sup>th</sup> hour (such as workers) may pray from ברוך שאמר until ישתבח as early as Dawn (even <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">לכתחילה</span>).<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעד סימן פט:יא</span> In those cases, one may also start קרבנות as early as 90<span class="footnote">see YY above; also Yeḥave Da'at - vol. II siman 8. There are two ways we've reached 90 minutes:<br>a) Increasing the length of a mil to 22.5 minutes. (Ḥatam Sofer)<br>b) Increasing the mil count used for Dawn, as Tosafot incidentally holds (somehow, their commentary to Berachot 2b includes a time of 5 mil)<br><br>Any earlier time would utilize a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק"), which is unsuitable when applied to the Talmud's description of the equinox-day.<br>The astronomical sightings are represented through math, where the length of a mil is a variable that affects all others. In our case, the length of a 24-mil changes the twilight period's to last 5 mil, since the days length of 720 minutes (12 hours of daylight multiplied by 60 minutes per hour) could only give us 30 of the 24-minute mil (24\*30). This does not correlate to any astronomical sighting, considering the first glimmer of light appears much later than 120 minutes before dawn, specifically when the sun is at 18&deg;. Furthermore, we appeal to the Gemara's later authority, who concluded that there can only be 4 mil for the twilight periods.<br><br>As such, we forego the 24 minute mil altogether for Dawn (which isn't against the Rambam, since even the Rambam held that Dawn is measured at 72 minutes; see Pirush Mishnayot Berachot 1:1) and use the closest available position, held at 90 minutes.</span> seasonal<span class="footnote">There is no reason to suggest that anything beyond the length of a mil is subject to sacrifice.</span> minutes before sunrise, since there is no concern of ספק ברכות להקל before ברוך שאמר.

When using adjusted-seasonal minutes outside israel/regular seasonal minutes in Israel, the differences between degree-calculated time and ours is very minimal in the summer months.

###### Misheyakir

As said above, Dawn is the time one can start receiting the blessings of פסוקי דזימרה. However, those actually using said early time for פסוקי דזמרה will find their momentum halted by ישתבח, considering the portion of prayer that follows (ברכות קריאת שמע) demands a separate time called **Misheyakir**. The description of this time is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet,<span class="footnote">ברכות בבלי ט</span> and distinguish between white & tekhelet.<span class="footnote">The Bet Yosef (O"Ḥ 58:2) asserts these two times are one in the same.</span> Once this time comes, one can also put on the other two dependents of this time; טלית ותפיליו. The three מצות dependent on this time each utilize recognition in their own right, as such:

- Dawning Tefilin at nighttime violates a Rabbinic prohibition;<span class="footnote">Although the Talmud (Menachot Bavli 36b) discusses which prohibition one transgresses by dawning Tefilin at nighttime, Ravina introduces a testimony from Rav Ashe that he wore Tefilin at nighttime. Nevertheless, we employ the statement of "הלכה ואין מורין כן" to retain its problematic status.<br>The Rambam's codification of the law (MT, Laws of Tefilin, 4:11) continues the train of thought that there is a Biblical transgression of a negative commandment (as is the view of R' Yoḥanan in the Talmud debate above; see Kessef Mishne), using an <i>Asmachta</i> of "<i>וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֛</i> אֶת־הַחֻקָּ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לְמוֹעֲדָ֑הּ <i>מִיָּמִ֖ים</i> יָמִֽימָה׃" to the verse prior of "וְהָיָה֩ לְךָ֨ לְא֜וֹת עַל־יָדְךָ֗ וּלְזִכָּרוֹן֙ בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֔יךָ". However, Maran (S"A O"Ḥ 30:2) used the other foremost authority (Rosh, Laws of Tefilin 16-17) to indicate that dawning Tefilin at nighttime is permitted by Torah law; rather, dawning them during nighttime was forbidden through a decree by the Sages out of a concern that one would sleep with them on.</span> the prohibition ends, though, after the time that "וְרָאוּ֙ כׇּל־עַמֵּ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּ֛י שֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָ֖ה נִקְרָ֣א עָלֶ֑יךָ" could happen<span class="footnote">Rabbenu Yonah's utilization of the verse (Deuteronomy 28:10), found on the Rif's version of ברכות בבלי in new Oz Vahadar pg 11/old pages 4b</span>
- The obligation of ציצית comes from a status of "וראיתם אותו",<span class="footnote">פרשת שלך, עליית מפטיר</span> making the commandment focused around the day. Thereby, according to all opinions, one does not fulfill the mitzvah if they wear a four-cornered night-time garment with ציצית at the night-time. On the other hand, one wearing a four-cornered day-time garment in the day-time with strings tied to each corner is fulfilling the commandment of ציצית according to all opinions. The gauge of what's considered day is from מישיכיר onwards.
