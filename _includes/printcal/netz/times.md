###### Dawn

The Halachic start of the day is Dawn, when the sun's rays can be seen in the lit-up Eastern part of the sky.<span class="footnote">Rosh, Berakhoth 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayoth Yoma 3:1; Shulḥan Arukh O.Ḥ. 89:1</span> In Hebrew, this time is either called <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עלות השחר</span><span class="footnote">Genesis 32:25. Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15</span> or <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עמוד השחר</span>.<span class="footnote">משנה ברכות א:א</span> Practically, the new day's obligations start from this time (such as not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even though active-commands should be delayed until sunrise when one is not in an pressing circumstance (although one who erroniously did it before sunrise is exempt post-facto). This also means that the night's commandments are no longer performable, such as Tiqqun Ḥaṣoth, Qeriath Shema (when not obmitted due to negligence) and the evening prayer.

For the Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> to determine how long this period of twilight lasts, the day's length (of 40 _mil_<span class="footnote">A mil is the distance of 2000 *Amot*. This is determined by basic math; S"A O"H 261:2 says that 75% (3&frasl;4) of a mil is 1500 amot</span>/10 *parasangs* of space converted to the amount of time it would take the average person to walk said space) is used as a reference. Whether subtracting the twilight periods<span class="footnote">A period of twilight also happens after sunset, with the astronomical phenomenon of "צאת כל הכוכבים" (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) happening at the proportionate length as the length of twilight from dawn until sunrise. Although this has no current practical halachic bearing (unlike the assertion of Rabbenu Tam, Gemara above), it is possible that this was an earlier opinion on how to determine nightfall, with the explanation in Shabbat 35b being the overridding opinion (as explained by the Geonim)</span> length from the 40 or adding them onto the 40,<span class="footnote">Although this debate (between the Bet Yosef saying the reserved <i>mil</i> is part of the 40 vs the GR"A saying that they're additional <i>mil</i>) is very important to determine which seasonal hours to use throughout the day, we have neglected to mention it here since a seasonal hour dependent on dawn could not be used to determine when dawn would be.</span> the primary matter of debate is how many of these mil are the ones reserved for twilight; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**, adjusted by the length of the day.<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסקים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span>

Using the Talmud's methodology through authoritative eyes, the basis of the conclusion is an astronomical reality equating itself to the passage of time. Further contextualization reveals that this discussion was surrounding Erev Pesaḥ, which is closer to the equinox.<span class="footnote">when the hours of day and night are equal. Although our current calendars never have the two align through coincidence, it is possible that they did at some point</span> Believing that the length of twilight was dependent on the length of the day throughout the whole year (meaning not just on the equinox)

Earlier/later times printed in other calendars presents issues of blessings in vain, not fulfilling your commandment obligations, eating before the time of prayer, and others. As such, we do **not** use other times for these matters<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef new Edition pg 475 siman 89:12</span>; the only leniency that's discussed is a 90 minute option<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef new Edition pg 474 siman 89:11. Other opinions not listed in the Yalkut Yosef involve a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק"), leaving even longer options of 96 or 120 minutes depending on which mil count is being used. However, a 24 minute mil can only work mathematically with the 5-mil interpretation; while 24\*30 (the amount of mil in a day without dawn and nightfall included) sits comfortably at 720 minutes (the length of the average day), increasing the mil to maintain like Rabbi Yehuda (24\*32) would extend the minutes limit by 48 minutes (768). Even if we decide to switch to the 5 mil opinion (letting the 24-minute mil be usable), 120 minutes (the result of 24\*5) is well outside the reach of when the first glimmer of light would appear on the horizon. As such, this opinion is the only other viable one available to us, outside of the fact that it does not suit our authorities.</span>, based on using alternative texts that did not refute Rava<span class="footnote">As the GR"A attempts to explain on the Rambam in S"A O"Ḥ 459:2</span>. Mathematically, this would also match a usecase of the 22.5-minute mil opinion, used by other authorities. Although authorities maintain this 90 minute-opinion is usable for recital of קרבנות (since authorities argue that this time *is* Dawn), the rule of ספק ברכות להקל would dictate one would *not* be able to advance to ברוך שאמר or onwards in prayer.

This Talmudic discussion One last factor that could elongate/shorten the length of a mil is by accounting for the expected astronomical result<span class="footnote">This is scientifically refered to as the sun's position below the horizon, measurable in the form of degrees.</span> of the 72-minute timespan (when reading the Gemara as just speaking about ארץ ישראל) rather than just the passage of time itself. Although the astronomically-correct way to factor these "degrees" in would be to match the degree every day, we're not concerned about the astronomical mismatch by using seasonal minutes (even during the winter, which is the biggest gab) evenly the resulting time's description in the Talmud as an astronomical reality rather than aby narrowing down the reading of  is R' David Yosef's opinion<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104)</span> of latitudinal deviation. base time of 72 minutes changes depending on how far one is from the equator in respect to Israel. This is done to factor the astronomical reality, where the duration of twilight expands/shrinks depending on its distance to the equator (meaning it could even be shorter than Israel's time). As such, rather than focusing on the codified time of 72 minutes, we would determine where the sun is positioned relative to the earth on the equinox day in Israel (scientifically referred to as "degrees below the horizon"). We would then apply that position/degree to the respective location on the equinox day, measure the resulting minutes before sunrise and make _those_ minutes seasonal. Since this position is subject to a dispute between R' David Yosef & R' Yitzḥak Yosef (Ein Yitzhak), we made this deviation accommodation in a mode labeled "Amudeh Hora'ah" mode. Those looking to maintain the status quo of standard seasonal minutes should switch to the "Ohr Hachaim" mode.

###### Misheyakir

Due to a concern that one would sleep with their pair of Tefilin, the Rabbis issued a restriction on having Tefilin during the nightime<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:2</span>. Instead, one must wait for the time of **Misheyakir**, which is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet.<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:1</span>.
