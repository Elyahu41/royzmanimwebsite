Dawn begins the halachic day, signified by the visibility of the sun's rays in the illuminated eastern sky.<span class="footnote">רא"ש, ברכות ד:א; רמב"ם פירוש המשניות ד:א; ש"ע א"ח פט:א</span> Practically, the new day's obligations start from this time (such as not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even though active-commands should be delayed until sunrise when one is not in an pressing circumstance (although one who erroniously did it before sunrise is exempt post-facto). This also means that the night's commandments are no longer performable, such as Tiqqun Ḥaṣoth, Qeriath Shema (when not obmitted due to negligence) and the evening prayer.

Although the definition of Dawn is based on astronomy, the Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> uses the length of the average day<span class="footnote">Each day is measured by it's length, making the average when the both the day and night span 12 hours. Rather than use our system of hours, we instead use space measurements, converted to the amount of time it takes to walk said space. Specifically, the measurements are 40 mil, with each mil being 2000 *Amot* long.<br>Sourcing involves math from S"A, which says (O"Ḥ 261:2) that 75% (3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s) of a singular mli is 1500 *Amot*</span> as a reference for how long the period of twilight following Dawn will be.<span class="footnote">Twilight is a time period that's used either within or in addition to (debate between the Bet Yosef & the GR"A, irrelevant for our discussion here even though it's relevant to defining a seasonal hour) the measurements of day, even though it's outside of the range from sunrise to sunset.<br>
The time period following sunset until "צאת כל הכוכבים" (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) is another period of twilight, as long as the morning's. However, there is a difference in practicality; whereas we're only concerned about the first 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil within that twilight's span of 4 mil (to make a period called בן השמשות, where it is neither day or night), the full 4 mil in the morning is used (for complete day). The reason why we apply the Halachics inconsistently comes from our Gemara being an earlier opinion, which was then changed by the time the Talmud was codified (see Rambam, Terumot UMaaserot, 7:2, according to his reading of Shabbat 34b)<br><br>
The challenge to this assertion comes from RT, who asserts that the parallels in our Gemara <i>holds</i> practical weight for the post-sunset twilight by recontextualizing the "conflicting Gemara" (Shabbat Bavli, 34b) as referring to a 2<sup>nd</sup> sunset. The בין השמשות (time of doubt whether its day or night, lasting 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil) following this sunset was then parraleled by the Ḥatam Sofer (commentary on S"A O"Ḥ 89, MG"A 2) for our Dawn purposes, where Dawn now starts a time period of doubt rather than be certain day. This time period of doubt would then finally be concluded by day, determined by "האיר פני המזרח" (effectively giving a new definition to our עלות השחר. Although the Ḥ"S himself doesn't say this, the Yalkut Yosef (5781 Edition, pg 464) learns as such based on the <i>Mishna Berura</i> (89:2) distinguishing between "שיאיר פני כל המזרח" and "שהבריק השחר כנקודה בלבד"). Nevertheless, both the premise law and the extrapolated law contradict our tradition of there being no resemblence in the conclusion of the "Talmudic contradiction" between the times post-sunset and pre-dawn, instead giving clear singular definitions to both Dawn and sunset.</span> The length of these twilights are subject to debate; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**.

The Talmud's methodology, viewed through an authoritative eye<span class="footnote">It is important to note, though, that there are few Rabbis who codified this <i>sugya</i> that did <b>not</b> contextualize the concluded time, and instead applied the concluded time to each respective day and respective location.<br>ע"ע תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכןת ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפח)</span>, necessitates contextualization and thus reinterpretation (away from the initial Erev Pesaḥ in Eretz Yisrael limitation) for the following accommodations:

1. The spring equinox (March 20<sup>th</sup>, used as reference to Erev Pesaḥ) features symmetrical lengths of daytime & nighttime. Days further feature varying lengths for both (with the greatest differences exhibiting on June 20<sup>th</sup> & December 20<sup>th</sup>, the solstices)
2. The _correlation_ between the passage of time and the astronomical descriptions given to our Halachic Dawn only matches in locations that surround Israel in the latitude. The descriptions of dawn closer match the _causation_ of the sun being at a certain position below the horizon, measurable at 16.04 degrees.

The Sepharadic custom uses "seasonal minutes" to accommodate the first factor, adjusting the twilight spans on the day's length.<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסקים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span> The second accommodation determines each location's "72 minute" equivalent by instead using the location's equinox-day 16.04&deg; response for the seasonal minutes.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104). Although R David writes one should only be stringent and increase, the logic of using it for leniencies by regular seasonal minutes also apply by these adjusted-seasonal minutes<br>This is <b>not</b> the typical application of degrees, as most calendars (including some from Sepharadic authorities; see the Kisse Raḥamim & Ahavat Shalom calendars) apply the degree to the location for that day itself, creating a consistent astronomical picture even in the winter time (where the astronomical truth does not reflect the halachic truth of seasonal minutes). Nevertheless, the difference between typical degree application and adjusted-seasonal minutes during the summer months is very minimal, and one would be able to use the times from those calendars (assuming the base of the degrees match our equinox-day times).</span> This "adjusted-seasonal" accommodations are labeled throughout our network as "Amudeh Hora'ah" mode, while the original seasonal behavior is deligated to the "Ohr Hachaim" mode.<span class="footnote">While R' Yitzḥak Yosef (עין יצחק ג' עמוד רל) does not explicitly argue against A"H mode, the words indicate there is no astronomical factor when it comes to determining the time of Dawn.</span>

The calendar times generated using our formula may result in either a leniency or a stringency, dependent on the scenario & the other time used in the comparsion. Due to the nature of how reliant we are on our time, *any* other formula that would generate more comfortable/lenient times may **not** be used to supersede our "stringencies", considering they use premises not adopted by our authorities.<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעה סימן פט:יב<br>Although the inverse is also true (that their authorities would not rely on our results), our authorities have held of our times even when it was visibly more lenient - פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span>. However, there are cases where we introduce further leniencies, whether due to an inaccessibility to our opinions or when our opinion is too stringent:

{:.fakeListItem}
Workers needing to pray as early as Dawn (which they can do <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">לחתחילה</span><span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעד סימן פט:יא</span>) may start קרבנות as early as 90<span class="footnote">see YY above; also Yeḥave Da'at - vol. II siman 8. There are two ways we've reached 90 minutes:<br>a) Increasing the length of a mil to 22.5 minutes. (Ḥatam Sofer)<br>b) Increasing the mil count used for Dawn, as Tosafot incidentally holds (somehow, their commentary to Berachot 2b includes a time of 5 mil)<br><br>Any earlier time would utilize a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק"), which is unsuitable when applied to the Talmud's description of the equinox-day.<br>The astronomical sightings are represented through math, where the length of a mil is a variable that affects all others. In our case, the length of a 24-mil changes the twilight period's to last 5 mil, since the days length of 720 minutes (12 hours of daylight multiplied by 60 minutes per hour) could only give us 30 of the 24-minute mil (24\*30). This does not correlate to any astronomical sighting, considering the first glimmer of light appears much later than 120 minutes before dawn, specifically when the sun is at 18&deg;. Furthermore, we appeal to the Gemara's later authority, who concluded that there can only be 4 mil for the twilight periods.<br><br>As such, we forego the 24 minute mil altogether for Dawn (which isn't against the Rambam, since even the Rambam held that Dawn is measured at 72 minutes; see Pirush Mishnayot Berachot 1:1) and use the closest available position, held at 90 minutes.</span> [seasonal]<span class="footnote">There is no reason to suggest that the further altercations to the time would be changed for the new accommodations.</span> minutes before sunrise, provided they do not proceed into ברוך שאמר onwards (which is subject to the rules of ספק ברכות להקל).

The following leniencies are also applicable to other times in the calendar

When using adjusted-seasonal minutes outside israel/regular seasonal minutes in Israel, the differences between degree-calculated time and ours is very minimal in the summer months.

###### Misheyakir

Although one can start ברוך שאמר onwards from the time of Dawn, their prayer takes a pause as they hit the closing blessing of ישתבח. The blessings of Shema (which follow ישתבח) can only be said after a time called **Misheyakir**, which is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet.<span class="footnote">ברכות בבלי ט</span> Similarly, since one needs this time for טלית and תפילין, a מניין פועלים would put them on following ישתבח but before יוצר אור.
