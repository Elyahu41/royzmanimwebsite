###### Dawn

The Halachic start of the day is Dawn, when the sun's rays can be seen in the lit-up Eastern part of the sky.<span class="footnote">Rosh, Berakhoth 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayoth Yoma 3:1; Shulḥan Arukh O.Ḥ. 89:1</span> In Hebrew, this time is either called <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עלות השחר</span><span class="footnote">Genesis 32:25. Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15</span> or <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">עמוד השחר</span>.<span class="footnote">משנה ברכות א:א</span> Practically, the new day's obligations start from this time (such as not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even though active-commands should be delayed until sunrise when one is not in an pressing circumstance (although one who erroniously did it before sunrise is exempt post-facto). This also means that the night's commandments are no longer performable, such as Tiqqun Ḥaṣoth, Qeriath Shema (when not obmitted due to negligence) and the evening prayer.

For the Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> to determine how long this period of twilight lasts, the day's length (of 40 _mil_<span class="footnote">A mil is the distance of 2000 *Amot*. This is determined by basic math; S"A O"H 261:2 says that 75% (3&frasl;4) of a mil is 1500 amot</span>/10 *parasangs* of space converted to the amount of time it would take the average person to walk said space) is used as a reference. Whether subtracting the twilight periods<span class="footnote">A period of twilight also happens after sunset, with the astronomical phenomenon of "צאת כל הכוכבים" (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) happening at the proportionate length as the length of twilight from dawn until sunrise. Although this has no current practical halachic bearing (unlike the assertion of Rabbenu Tam, Gemara above), it is possible that this was an earlier opinion on how to determine nightfall, with the explanation in Shabbat 35b being the overridding opinion (as explained by the Geonim)</span> length from the 40 or adding them onto the 40,<span class="footnote">Although this debate (between the Bet Yosef saying the reserved <i>mil</i> is part of the 40 vs the GR"A saying that they're additional <i>mil</i>) is very important to determine which seasonal hours to use throughout the day, we have neglected to mention it here since a seasonal hour dependent on dawn could not be used to determine when dawn would be, making it irrelevant for our purposes of explaining Dawn.</span> the primary matter of debate is how many of these mil are the ones reserved for twilight; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**.

The Talmud's methodology through an authoritative eye would mean contextualizing and reinterpreting the above as needed.<span class="footnote">It is important to note, though, that there are few Rabbis who codified this <i>sugya</i> that did <b>not</b> contextualize the concluded time, and instead applied the concluded time to each respective day and respective location.<br>ע"ע תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכןת ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפ"ח, )</span> There are two factors that would determine a change to the time above:

1. Since the Gemara's context was referring to Erev Pesaḥ, the length of twilight must differentiate between the different days of the seasons, with the drastic changes happening the furthest days away from the equinox days (where the days and nights are symmertical).
2. Even after narrowing down the above to be solely the equinox day, the length of astronomical twilight adjusts depending on how far one is from the equator (the Gemara was only talking about Eretz Yisrael, since that's where one would offer the Korban Pesaḥ). Thereby, minutes are just a correlation and one would need to find the causation itself and apply that to the respective location. Said causation is the position of the sun below the horizon, measurable in the form of degrees.

The Sepharadic custom has been to use "seasonal minutes" to accommodate the first factor, where the length of these minutes adjust depending on the length of the day.<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסקים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span> Although there is a disconnect when seasonal minutes are used in the winter months (where astronomical twilight outlengthens the seasonal minutes), we rely on our sages advice to use it even in the leniencies.<span class="footnote">פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span> For the second accommodation, the "Amudeh Hora'ah" mode uses degrees to replace the time of "72" used as the basis for seasonal minutes.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104). Although R David writes one should only be stringent and increase, the logic of using it for leniencies by regular seasonal minutes also apply by these adjusted-seasonal minutes</span> Since this is subject to dispute between R David & R Yitzḥak Yosef<span class="footnote">עין יצחק ג' עמוד רל</span>, the original seasonal behavior is left as the "Ohr Hachaim" mode.<span class="footnote">Although applying the degree to the respective location would solve both problems consistenly, it would create a conflict in the winter months between our custom of using minutes determined by the days length versus the astronomical truth. Nevertheless, this is the opinion of some Sepharadic calendars (R' Mazuz & Ahavat Shalom), hence why their 72-minute Dawn option is usable during the summer months where this conflict does not exist.</span>

Earlier/later times printed in other calendars presents issues of blessings in vain, not fulfilling your commandment obligations, eating before the time of prayer, and others. As such, we do **not** use other times for these matters<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef new Edition pg 475 siman 89:12</span>; the only leniency that's discussed is a 90 minute option<span class="footnote">Yalkut Yosef new Edition pg 474 siman 89:11. Other opinions not listed in the Yalkut Yosef involve a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק"), leaving even longer options of 96 or 120 minutes depending on which mil count is being used. However, a 24 minute mil can only work mathematically with the 5-mil interpretation; while 24\*30 (the amount of mil in a day without dawn and nightfall included) sits comfortably at 720 minutes (the length of the average day), increasing the mil to maintain like Rabbi Yehuda (24\*32) would extend the minutes limit by 48 minutes (768). Even if we decide to switch to the 5 mil opinion (letting the 24-minute mil be usable), 120 minutes (the result of 24\*5) is well outside the reach of when the first glimmer of light would appear on the horizon. As such, this opinion is the only other viable one available to us, outside of the fact that it does not suit our authorities.</span>, based on using alternative texts that did not refute Rava<span class="footnote">As the GR"A attempts to explain on the Rambam in S"A O"Ḥ 459:2</span>. Mathematically, this would also match a usecase of the 22.5-minute mil opinion, used by other authorities. Although authorities maintain this 90 minute-opinion is usable for recital of קרבנות (since authorities argue that this time *is* Dawn), the rule of ספק ברכות להקל would dictate one would *not* be able to advance to ברוך שאמר or onwards in prayer.

###### Misheyakir

Due to a concern that one would sleep with their pair of Tefilin, the Rabbis issued a restriction on having Tefilin during the nightime<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:2</span>. Instead, one must wait for the time of **Misheyakir**, which is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet.<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:1</span>.
