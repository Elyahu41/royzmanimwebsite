Dawn begins the halachic day, signified by the visibility of the sun's rays in the illuminated eastern sky.<span class="footnote">רא"ש, ברכות ד:א; רמב"ם פירוש המשניות ד:א; ש"ע א"ח פט:א</span> Practically, the new day's obligations start from this time (such as not eating before prayer<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even though active-commands should be delayed until sunrise when one is not in an pressing circumstance (although one who erroniously did it before sunrise is exempt post-facto). This also means that the night's commandments are no longer performable, such as Tiqqun Ḥaṣoth, Qeriath Shema (when not obmitted due to negligence) and the evening prayer.

The Talmud<span class="footnote">פסחים בבלי צד</span> determines the length of the twilight period (which, by extension, also determines how long before sunrise does Dawn take place) by using the day's length (of 40 _mil_<span class="footnote">A mil is the distance of 2000 *Amot*. This is determined by basic math; S"A O"Ḥ 261:2 says that 75% (3&frasl;4) of a mil is 1500 amot</span>/10 *parasangs* of space converted to the amount of time it would take the average person to walk said space) as a reference. Whether subtracting the twilight periods<span class="footnote">A period of twilight also happens after sunset, concluding after the same length of our twilight with the astronomical phenomenon of "צאת כל הכוכבים". (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261) Both periods of twilight are used to determine the halachic time of Dawn, even though the other twilight bears no practical bearing on our Halachic timeframe.<br>R"T asserts that the parallels in our Gemara <i>holds</i> practical weight for the post-sunset twilight by recontextualizing the "conflicting Gemara" (Shabbat Bavli, 34b) as referring to a 2<sup>nd</sup> sunset. The בין השמשות (time of doubt whether its day or night, lasting 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil) following this sunset was then parraleled by the Ḥatam Sofer (commentary on S"A O"Ḥ 89, MG"A 2) for our Dawn purposes, where Dawn now starts a time period of doubt rather than be certain day. This time period of doubt would then finally be concluded by day, determined by "האיר פני המזרח" (effectively giving a new definition to our עלות השחר. Although the Ḥ"S himself doesn't say this, the Yalkut Yosef (5781 Edition, pg 464) learns as such based on the <i>Mishna Berura</i> (89:2) distinguishing between "שיאיר פני כל המזרח" and "שהבריק השחר כנקודה בלבד"). Nevertheless, both the premise law and the extrapolated law contradict our tradition of there being no resemblence in the conclusion of the "Talmudic contradiction" between the times post-sunset and pre-dawn, instead giving clear singular definitions to both Dawn and sunset. The </span> length from the 40 or adding them onto the 40,<span class="footnote">Although this debate (between the Bet Yosef saying the reserved <i>mil</i> is part of the 40 vs the GR"A saying that they're additional <i>mil</i>) is very important to determine which seasonal hours to use throughout the day, we have neglected to mention it here since a seasonal hour dependent on dawn could not be used to determine when dawn would be, making it irrelevant for our purposes of explaining Dawn.</span> the primary matter of debate is how many of these mil are the ones reserved for twilight; although Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement) reserves 10 mil (leaving only _30 mil_ for the rest of the day), our texts of the Gemara concludes like Rabbi Yehuda that only reserves 8 mil (leaving an extra 2 mil for the day's length). Thereby, our _4 mil_ of twilight between Dawn to Sunrise with every mil being measured as **18 minutes long**<span class="footnote">ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> gives us a time of dawn that is **72 minutes**.

The Talmud's methodology, viewed through an authoritative eye<span class="footnote">It is important to note, though, that there are few Rabbis who codified this <i>sugya</i> that did <b>not</b> contextualize the concluded time, and instead applied the concluded time to each respective day and respective location.<br>ע"ע תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכןת ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפ"ח)</span>, necessitates contextualization and thus reinterpretation (away from the initial Erev Pesaḥ in Eretz Yisrael limitation) for the following accommodations:

1. The spring equinox (March 20<sup>th</sup>, used as reference to Erev Pesaḥ) features symmetrical lengths of daytime & nighttime. Days further feature varying lengths for both (with the greatest differences exhibiting on June 20<sup>th</sup> & December 20<sup>th</sup>, the solstices)
2. The _correlation_ between the passage of time and the astronomical descriptions given to our Halachic Dawn only matches in locations that surround Israel in the latitude. The descriptions of dawn closer match the _causation_ of the sun being at a certain position below the horizon, measurable at 16.04 degrees.

The Sepharadic custom uses "seasonal minutes" to accommodate the first factor, adjusting the twilight spans on the day's length.<span class="footnote">מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסקים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)</span> The second accommodation determines each location's "72 minute" equivalent by instead using the location's equinox-day 16.04&deg; response for the seasonal minutes.<span class="footnote">Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104).

Nevertheless, the difference between typical degree application and adjusted-seasonal minutes during the summer months is very minimal, and one would be able to use the times from those calendars (assuming the base of the degrees match our equinox-day times).</span> This "adjusted-seasonal" accommodations are labeled throughout our network as "Amudeh Hora'ah" mode, while the original seasonal behavior is deligated to the "Ohr Hachaim" mode.<span class="footnote">While R' Yitzḥak Yosef (עין יצחק ג' עמוד רל) does not explicitly argue against R' David Yosef's opinion (next line, main text), the words indicate there is no astronomical factor when it comes to determining the time of Dawn.</span>

_Any_ altercation (whether earlier or later) to the time of dawn will introduce both stringencies & leniencies, all depending heavily on a case-by-case basis, with various scenarios to cover. As such, to avoid being unreliably lenient,<span class="footnote">Leniencies provided by our methodology of seasonal time is not within this definition, as we rely on our sages's advice.<br>פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span> one should **not** depend on other methods that would provide more convenient times.<span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעה סימן פט:יב</span> Nevertheless, workers that need to pray early (which they can do <span style="unicode-bidi: isolate;">לחתחילה</span><span class="footnote">י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעד סימן פט:יא</span>), *could* start קרבנות at an earlier time of 90 [adjusted-]seasonal minutes<span class="footnote">Although we do not sacrifice our methodology/adjustments, our initial position of 72 minutes is the one being switched (see YY above; also Yeḥave Da'at - vol. II siman 8)<br>Any earlier time would utilize a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by Rambam, Pirush Mishnayoth Pesaḥim 3:2, end of "בצק"), which is unsuitable when applied to the Talmud's description of the equinox-day measurements. A 24 mil could only fit the day's length of 720 minutes (12 hours of daylight multiplied by 60 minutes per hour) into a 30-mil day (24\*30), meaning it cannot conclude like Rabbi Yehuda (which our texts use). Even utilizing the initial position of our Gemara (5 mil) would give us a twilight length of 120 minutes, which is impractical  for the purposes of Korbanot & presents astronomical inaccuracies (since the first glimmer of light only appears at 18&deg;, far later than the result of 120). As such, we forego the 24 minute mil altogether for Dawn (which isn't against the Rambam, since even the Rambam held that Dawn is measured at 72 minutes; see Pirush Mishnayot Berachot 1:1) and use the closest available position, held at 90 minutes. This position comes from two possible explanations:<br><br>1. Increasing the length of a mil to 22.5 minutes.<br>2. Increasing the mil count used for Dawn, like Tosafot.<br><br>OLD STUFF BELOW: to get a 90 minute dawn by 4 mil, only not used on a typical basis because of our custom not doing that prior.<br>One attempted way to get at 90 minutes is to apply the GR"A's explanations on the Rambam (Biur HaGR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 459:2) in unsuitable fashions, cherry picking details to get a conclusion that neither the Rambam or the GR"A would hold. This means measuring the 40 mil of the day from sunrise until sunset (contradicting the only way to get to 24, as used in Pirush Mishnayot Pesaḥim, ibid) to then make the extra mil from the twilight times on top of the 40. These extra mil would be 5 mil instead of 4 (which although goes against our text of the Gemara, the GR"A says that perhaps the Rambam had a varient text supporting it. Nevertheless, that would only explain why he would use it by Pesaḥim; there's no reason for him to use it here, and in fact, he doesn't - Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Berachot 1:1 says explicitly 72 minutes, which is equivalent to 4 mil). Setting aside the technical details of authorities and variant texts, the GR"A's main point to the paper was to reconsile the two conflicting lengths of a mil; the Ḥidush used of additional mil, though, does not match what his explanation to Pesaḥim would have wanted. His commentary explicitly says there 15 mil between sunrise and midday, with a mirror for midday until sunset; 15 multiplied by 2 is 30, not 40.</span> before sunrise, provided they do not proceed into ברוך שאמר onwards (which is subject to the rules of ספק ברכות להקל).

###### Misheyakir

Due to a concern that one would sleep with their pair of Tefilin, the Rabbis issued a restriction on having Tefilin during the nightime<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:2</span>. Instead, one must wait for the time of **Misheyakir**, which is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet.<span class="footnote">S"A O"Ḥ 30:1</span>.
