###### Sunrise/Sunset

These times are the fundamentals for all Halachic Zemanim, which is provided to us via the <b>NOAA algorithm</b>. The Amudeh Hora'ah calendar does not use elevation.

For sunrise, we offer "Visible Sunrise" scraping from the ChaiTables.com website.

###### Seasonal Hours + Alot/Tzet

We use seasonal hours for both times within the day **and** times before sunrise/after sunset. In the later's case, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar uses degrees to represent seasonal minutes on an equinox day, thereby matching the astronomy on the equinox day while still using its seasonal minutes for other days of the week.

Since we hold a mil is 18 minutes, 3/4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil is 13 ½ minutes (used for Geonim's nightfall) and 4 mil is 72 minutes (used for dawn and R"T's nightfall). For special occasions (such as ending a fast), we would switch to the Rambam's mil equivalence of 24 minutes, making 3/4<sup>th</sup> of it as 18 minutes. From there, we would round it up to the nearest 10, making it 20 seasonal minutes after sunset.

All of our times are calculated seasonally according to the GR"A (from sunrise -> sunset), with the exception of Keriath Shema & times associated with Hametz. For those two, we calculate our seasonal minutes from dawn until nightfall, giving us an earlier "stringent" time. In addition, we use two other safeguards for other times:

- For Minḥa Ketanah, we use 30 fixed minutes as an minimum for the winter months.
- Shabbat needs some conformity to astronomical sightings, so we use pure degrees in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar (7.14) and 40 minutes for the Ohr Hachaim calendar.

###### Ḥatzot

Everyday is counted *independently* (as opposed to a mean value), being the halfway point between sunrise->sunset (not sunrise->tzet)

###### Plag Haminḥa

In addition to the GR"A's Plag Haminḥa (held by Maran Ovadia in Halichot Olam & R' David in Halacha Berurah), we offer the time for Plag Haminḥa according to R' Yitzhak Yosef & R' Avraham Yosef. This retains the GR"A's seasonal minutes while counting backwards from the Geonic nightfall (which as established above is 13 ½ minutes after sunset).

###### Candle Lighting

Although the timeframe before sunset is varied according to minhag, Halacha dictates it cannot be over 30 fixed minutes unless one would accept Shabbat at the moment they light (even for Sepharadim who typically aren't concerned from these words of the Beha"g that one accepts Shabbat as they light). Our calendar default uses 20 minutes, based on trying to count backwards from sunset 3/4<sup>th</sup>'s of the Rambam's mil (which is 24 minutes), rounded up to the closest number.

###### Rabbenu Tam

Athough Maran zt'l held by R"T's seasonal minutes consistently (with both leniencies and stringencies), both R' David Yosef & R' Yitzhak Yosef held otherwise for the stringency, saying one need only to cap it off by 72 fixed minutes. The "Amudeh Hora'ah" calendar reflects this by using (adjusted-)seasonal minutes only when it doesn't go above 72 fixed minutes.

###### Tekufot

This is a concept no other calendar lists, and explaining it here would require documenting the entire practice (which is too long for our purposes). Please reference the back of the PDF for an explanation.

###### Birkat Halevana
Between Sepharadim and Ashkenazim, we start later (because we start by day 7 rather than day 3) and end later. Whereas starting later is just whatever time we start + 96 hours, we end later because we say Birkat Halevana throughout the night of the 15th while the Rama wants to match the molad.

###### Molad
Although Ashkenazic (+ some Sepharadic) communities announce the specific time that the molad takes place, we ommited this formula as per the normative Minhag Eretz Yisrael.
