###### Seasonal Hours + Alot/Tzet

We use the length of the day from sunrise until sunset to determine all Halachic times, whether within the day or *times before sunrise/after sunset*. This means that, just like degree calculations (and unlike some calendars that used fixed minutes), these times are longer in the summer; that's because the days are longer in the summer. However, unlike both degrees calculation (for times outside sunrise->sunset) and fixed minutes, these times are *shorter* in the winter months, despite astronomy dictating that these times should be longer for times outside the day's length. There are a few exceptions, though, when we use other methods of calculation (dawn->nightfall seasonal, degrees, fixed) instead of seasonal sunrise->sunset times:

- Keriath Shema & Hametz use seasonal time calculated from Dawn until nightfall
- Minḥa Gedolah uses a fixed 30 minute minimum, for the winter months
- Shabbat needs some conformity to astronomical sightings, so we use pure degrees in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar (7.14) and 40 minutes for the Ohr Hachaim calendar.
- Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall displays a maximum of 72 fixed minutes in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar, based on both R' Yitzhak Yosef & R' David Yosef. This does **not** apply to the Ohr Hachaim calendar, though, which explicitly follows R' Ovadia that said one *should* use 72 seasonal minutes, both for leniencies & stringencies.
- Candle Lighting times are using fixed minutes before sunset, due to the entire concept being based on recognition for Shabbat. We use 20 fixed minutes, based on rounding up a mil's length (discussed later on).

For the time portions outside of the days length, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar uses the degree-based time for the equinox day and makes those minutes seasonal. Thereby, 13.5 seasonal minutes becomes 16.5 seasonal minutes in NY, due to 13.5 minutes matching 3.77 degees in Israel and also matching 16.5 minutes in NY.

The Talmudic way of referring to the length of time behind these times is a "mil", which we hold is 18 minutes. Thereby, ¾<sup>th</sup> of a mil is 13 ½ minutes (used for Geonim's nightfall) and 4 mil is 72 minutes (used for dawn and R"T's nightfall). For special occasions (such as ending a fast), we would switch to the Rambam's mil equivalence of 24 minutes, making 3/4<sup>th</sup> of it as 18 minutes. From there, we would round it up to the nearest 10, making it 20 seasonal minutes after sunset.

###### Sunrise/Sunset

When reporting the times for the calendar, the given time differs from the sunrise/sunset times used to compute seasonal hours in the following regards:
- These times will always be shown without elevation (regardless of whether elevation is used for calculating the other times (like in the Ohr Hachaim calendar) or not (like in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar)).
- The sunrise time will use the "Visible Sunrise" scraped from the ChaiTables.com website if the user had scraped it prior to generating this PDF.

These times are provided from the **NOAA algorithm**.

###### Ḥatzot

Everyday is counted *independently* (as opposed to a mean value), being the halfway point between sunrise->sunset (not sunrise->tzet)

###### Plag Haminḥa

In addition to the GR"A's Plag Haminḥa (held by Maran Ovadia in Halichot Olam & R' David in Halacha Berurah), we offer the time for Plag Haminḥa according to R' Yitzhak Yosef & R' Avraham Yosef. This retains the GR"A's seasonal minutes while counting backwards from the Geonic nightfall (which as established above is 13 ½ minutes after sunset).

###### Tekufot

This is a concept no other calendar lists, and explaining it here would require documenting the entire practice (which is too long for our purposes). Please reference the back of the PDF for an explanation.

###### Birkat Halevana
Between Sepharadim and Ashkenazim, we start later (because we start by day 7 rather than day 3) and end later. Whereas starting later is just whatever time we start + 96 hours, we end later because we say Birkat Halevana throughout the night of the 15th while the Rama wants to match the molad.

###### Molad
Although Ashkenazic (+ some Sepharadic) communities announce the specific time that the molad takes place, we ommited this formula as per the normative Minhag Eretz Yisrael.
