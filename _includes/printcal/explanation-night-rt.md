###### Night (Three Stars)

Night in halacha is defined by the emergence of three stars,<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שבת בבלי לה:</span></span> which happens after 13½ seasonal minutes.<span data-footnote>הליכות עולם (ח"א עמוד רנ), חזון עובדיה (יו"ט עמוד רלב ודש; ארבע תעניות עמוד טו; חנוכה עמוד עג)</span> post-sunset<span data-footnote>Some may wonder: How is it possible for three stars to be visible in such a short time after sunset? Several authorities explain that the sign of stars is indeed not so easily discernable to the average person (even with good vision and visibility) because they are miniscule points within a broad picture, requiring even a faint star to be fixated on (while knowing where it would even first appear) prior to being able to discern it (ספר "לילה ויום של תורה" דף קע"ה והזמנים בהלכה ב' דפים תפ"ח-תצ"ג) in contrast to the vastly large sky background (יביע אומר ז' מ"א:ז' בשם גרא"ז, פני יהושע, גר"א). Light pollution is also a factor, which means that those living in cities are simply unable to see three stars immediately as they emerge.</span> This period ends the transition time of בין השמשות, with one now having fully entered the new Halachic day.

Many laws are predicated on the beginning of the night,<span data-footnote>Such as ending Tefilath Minḥa (Y.Y. 235 5), Hefsek Taharah (Taharat HaBayit vol. 2 pages 265-274), Shvut beMakom Mitzvah on Friday afternoon (H.B. 261 1), Earliest Keriath Shema of night (S.A. 235 1) and of many other mitzvot.</span> yet certain laws may encourage us to be stricter in specific cases<span data-footnote>Many apply these stringencies to rules that are inapplicable for it, yet this may cause issues at times (like missing out on the Rambam's time for הדלקת נרות חנוכה, the commandment of הגדת לבנך on פסח and fasting while it's שבת on עשרה בטבת שכל בערב שבת). Furthermore, we must stress that these are *stringencies* and one may **not** use this time when it is more lenient (like תפילה בבין השמשות or ספירת העומר for the previous day)</span>:

Although all Rabbinic matters can use the regular nightfall, the recommended exception to make is by ending a Rabbinic fast<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה ארבע צומות דף יב.</span>, which instead uses the Rambam's time of 20 minutes post-sunset. Both calendars modes calculate this differently: While the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar chooses to list this daily and calculate the time through its (adjusted-)seasonal minutes, the Ohr Hachaim calendar simplifies this to only show by days which require this stringency (such as fasts) and calculates these minutes as fixed 60 seconds.

Extremely pious people throughout Sepharadic history<span data-footnote>ראה באור לציון ד' פרק כ' הערה ב' וגם השיטות שבמקורות של מוצאי שבת</span> were stringent to use the time of Nightfall according to _Rabbenu Tam_<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">פסחים בבלי צד.</span></span>, which is 72 seasonal minutes after sunset. As such, the _recommended_ practice is to wait until this time for matters of Biblical stringency (such as <span class="hebMidWord">עשיית מלכה במוצאי שבת ויום קיפור</span><span data-footnote>יביע עומר ב' סימן כ"א</span> and repeating קריאת שמע של ערבית if they said it after the Geonic nightfall<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">ילקוט יוסף רל"ה:ב'</span>. If it was before the Geonic nightfall, it is not a recommendation and one would need to repeat it regardless</span>), especially considering this was the fundamental time for nightfall held by the Shulḥan Arukh.<span data-footnote>או"ח סימן רס"א:ב. כן הוא ברוב הראשונים. We do not hold by this interpretation of nightfall as the fundamental time since the minhag has already been established like the Geonim, who've solved the "contradiction in Gemara's" by either timelining each position of R' Yehuda (Maram Alashkar 94, quoting Teshuvat HaGeonim) or dismissing it as an astronomic time (גר"א על שו"ע או"ח סימן רס"א)</span>

Since the letter-of-the-law opinion had already been followed, one can consider various leniencies to accommodate this already strict opinion<span data-footnote>These leniencies are not applicable to the Geonic times, where the letter-of-the-law opinions have <i>not</i> yet been followed.</span> when following it for practice.<span data-footnote>These leniencies are not factored into how long a Biblical seasonal hours would last; they rely on proportionate times, meaning the 72 seasonal minutes for Dawn will be the same 72 seasonal minutes for Nightfall.</span> These leniencies include using the a "Safek Safeka" to include Rabbenu Tam's period of twilight (lasting 13.5 minutes)<span data-footnote>ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשנ"ב) סימן רצ"ג הלכה ה</span> and limiting the time of Rabbenu Tam to 72 fixed minutes<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה חדשה) סימן רצ"ג עמוד תשכד; הלכה ברורה, הקדמת לסימן רס"א הלכה י"ט; יודעי בינה ז':ו'</span></span>

Regarding what time one may take out שבת, we keep an additional time of <span class="hebMidWord">תוספת שבת</span><span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שו"ע או"ח רצ"ג:א'</span></span> on top of the extended time of <span class="hebMidWord">בין השמשות</span>.<span data-footnote>We use the 20 minute opinion over the regular 13.5 minute version to include the Rambam's time of צאת הכוכבים, with an added two minutes to accommodate רב יוסי's opinion on בין השמשות. To avoid any potential acts of descecration, we have chosen to hide the regular nightfall time time for any Shabbat/Yom Tov. Those looking to use it for legitimate purposes (such as the latest time one could start שעודת שלישית בדיעבד) should look to applying this time *from the prior/following day* (whichever is more stringent).</span> Although any amount of time can be added for this, Maran Ovadya zt"l held that one should only do melakha after waiting 30 fixed minutes post-sunset in Israel.<span data-footnote>See Yehave Da'at (vol. 7 siman 56) Yalkut Yosef (New Edition siman 293 page 715). See Zivchey Tzedek (vol. 2 y.d. siman 17 page 66 & vol. 3 siman 104 page 198).</span> Even though this is purely additional, there are stricter halachic opinions of what nightfall is that are encompased within this 30 fixed minute time:<span data-footnote>This works in our favor as the Shulḥan Arukh (<span class="hebMidWord">או"ח רצ"ג:ב'</span>) says that one should wait until any element of doubt is removed before taking out Shabbat. Although the context is specifically in reference to an astronomical doubt (which is relevant to how they determined times before calendars), it is a display of humility to respect שיטת הפוסקים when tackling such a potential transgression of חלול שבת</span>

The time measurement is as long as **27 minutes**.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">בא"ח, (שנה ראשון) ויקהל ד', אור לציון א' יו"ד סימן י'. כל בפסק הלכה בשם רב יצחק יוסף בעין יצחק חלק ג אמוד ת"ב</span></span> This is based on the Stringent Nightfall's 20-minute *mil* with an additional 7 minutes to account for the מוגרב.

This would be an **astronomical** time, independent of the law-based seasonal-minute calculation. We accommodate this for locations outside Eretz Yisrael by measuring where the sun would be below the horizon 30 minutes below the horizon on the equinox day in Eretz Yisrael, and apply that "degree count" (7.14º) everywhere.<span data-footnote>Although there is precedent to use methods that would result in even shorter times (ילקוט טהרה מכתב עז), we have used this stricter measurement to ensure one would not be more lenient than the printed Ohr Hachaim calendar when applied to Eretz Yisrael.</span>

As a standard minimum, the greater of 20 seasonal minutes and 20 fixed minutes is used. This is done to enforce the legal time for locations closer to the equator (like Panama) that may have an astronomical nightfall earlier than when we could halachically take out Shabbat.
