These are the times associated with Mincha, the afternoon prayer.

- **Mincha Gedolah:** This is half an hour after Hatzot Hayom. The measurement of half an hour is the more stringent of seasonal or fixed minutes.
- **Mincha Ketanah:** 9 1/2 seasonal hours after sunrise. This is the more preferable time to pray (Yalkut Yosef 233:1).

Each of those are named based on how much time you would have to pray Mincha; you have a big time at Mincha Gedolah and you have a shorter timeframe at Mincha Ketanah. Saying Korbanot is tied to these times; do not aim just to start Amidah by this time.
