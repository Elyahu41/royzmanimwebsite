The Mishnah in Massechet Brachoth (1:2) records a מחלוקת תנאים on the regarding by when one should have fulfilled is the original source that describes the latest time to finish reciting קריאת שמע (Shema). Although R' Eliezer there holds that one has until Halachic midday, Shmuel in the Talmud (Bavli, 10b) declared that we hold like R' Yehoshua, who limits it as three seasonal hours into the day. The simple definition of a day is 12 Halachic hours, of which we have two different opinions on how to calculate them:

- The Terumat Hadeshen (reflected in the Magen Avraham, Orach Hayim 58:1) held that these seasonal hours are calculated by taking the time from **Aloth Hashachar** until **Rabbeinu Tam's Tzeit Hakokhavim**. This is the time that Sepharadim are supposed to be stringent for, which ends up being 37 seasonal minutes before the later time (calculated on an equinox day).
- The later time is brought down by the Vilna Gaon (reflected in Biur HaGra, Orach Hayim, siman 459) and the Levush (siman 233 & siman 267), who calculates seasonal hours by dividing the time between *Sunrise* and *Sunset* into 12 spans of time. As such, since we lose aren't including the 144 added seasonal minutes from Aloth and Tzeit, this time ends up being pushed later.

Within these calculations, we hold like the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Hayim, 58:6) as well as the majority of Rishonim [Rambam (Kriyat Shema 1:11), Chinuch 420 & Tosfot (Avoda Zara 4b s.v. Betelat)], who hold that it's the _end_ of the 3<sup>rd</sup> hour. This is against the Machsor Vitri (1 pg 7) & Siddur Rav Amram (1:15-16), who rule that it's at the beginning of the third hour.
