This time is the third hour of the day, by when people of luxury would arise in the morning. The תנאים codified this time to have one complete קריאת שמע before then (R' Yehoshua in Mishnah Berachot 1:2, Shemuel in Talmud Bavli 10b), based on the word ובקומך.

To calculate this one, one has to know the definition of the Halachic day. Although the Vilna Gaon (reflected in Biur HaGra, Orach Hayim, siman 459) and Levush (siman 233 & siman 267) defines the day period as sunrise->sunset, there is the stringent opinion of the Terumat Hadeshen to count from Alot Hashachar until Rabbeinu Tam's Tzet Hakokhavim. As per the ruling of the Maghen Avraham (Orach Hayim 58:1), we are stringent when it comes to matters of Biblical timings to use the Terumat Hadeshen's times. However, one who missed the time should attempt to make it by the GRA's time instead.

Within the seasonal hour, there are two time periods; the beginning of the hour or the end of the hour. Although the Geonic era of Poskim hold by the beginning of the third hour (Machzor Vitri I pg 7; Siddur Rav Amran 1:15-16), the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Hayim, 58:6) held like the Rambam (Kriat Shema 1:11) as well as other Risonim (Chinuch 420; Tosafot Avodah Zara 4b s.v. Betelat) who instead calculate it by the end of the third hour.
