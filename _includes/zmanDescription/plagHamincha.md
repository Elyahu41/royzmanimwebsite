Plag Hamincha is, as the hebrew name implies (Plag=half), the halftime point from Mincha Ketanah to Shekiya. A select few mitzvot of the night can start being done from now, such as accepting Shabbat early (Orach Chayim, 273:4) or praying the night time Tefilah when one already prayed Mincha (Berachot 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

When accounting for Mincha Ketanah's length being 2½ seasonal hours long from its start until Shekiya (of which this time is supposed to be close towards), half of that would be 1¼ seasonal hours. However, this time is actually calculated in reverse from the time called "ערב", which is unclear as to whether it refers to שקיעה (which starts entering a ספק לילה) or צאת הכוכבים (when it is לילה ודאי). The Rambam (Hilchot Tefilah 3:4), Kaf Hachaim (273:7), Halichot Olam (vol. 1 pg. 248) & Halacha Berurah all agree that we count backwards from Shekiya, being a more literal interpretation of the "half-point" treatment. However, the Ben Ish Hai, Ohr Letzion & Yalkut Yosef intrepret the word "ערב" to be the actual night; צאת הכוכבים (based on the Geonim). As such, this takes on a stringency of 13.5 minutes after the "lenient" position, since they still calculate the 1¼ seasonal hours according to the Vilna Gaon's sunrise to sunset method.

In practicality, the Ohr Hachaim calendar chooses to list only the Yalkut Yosef time. However, the Amudeh Hora'ah that has a later "Tzet Hakochavim" time lists both, possibly to account for places that there would be a grander difference. In practicality, while the Yalkut Yosef time is more ideal, one can rely on the Halacha Berurah time for Rabbinical commandments (such as Tefilah and Shabbat Candles).

Interestingly enough, this seems to be another place where the timeframe is attributed by how long it would take to walk a certain distance, much like Alot HaShachar & Tzet Hakochavim with its "mil" calculation. However, there are different Girsaot on how long it is; one says 334 Amot and the other says 400 Amot. The reason why it is interesting is because they could have said the full length of Mincha Ketanah and we could have instead inferred how much half of that would be.
