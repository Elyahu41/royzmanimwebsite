The time from מנחה קטנה until the end of the day is divided into two halves, each lasting 1¼ seasonal hours (Berachot Bavli 27a, since מנחה קטנה itself lasts 2½ seasonal hours). By the second half (which we call פלג המנחה), one can start performing a select few commandments of the night, such as accepting Shabbat early (Orach Chayim, 273:4), lighting Ḥanukah candles early (footnotes of Ḥazon Ovadia Hanukah pg. 89) or praying תפילת ערבית when one (preferably) already prayed Minḥa (Berachot 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

The Mishnah in Berachot 4:1 introduces the time of פלג המנחה by contrasting it from ערב, which is the official endpoint of the day. Under traditional methods of determining halachic times, this involved proportional time away from midday, which also reflects on when the day starts. Within the rulings of R' Ovadia that Rabbinic times are measured by sunrise to sunset (Halikhot Olam, vol. 1 pg. 248), פלג המנחה would be 1¼ seasonal hours before _sunset_ (as written in the Rambam Hilkhot Tefila 3:4, Kaf Hachaim 233:7, Shilteh Hagiborim on the Mordekhi & R' Yitzḥak Yisraeli's explanation of the Meiri - Yoseh Binah pg. 105). Rabbenu Ḥananel implicitly supports this by quoting R' Yehuda's parralel between the rules of the שתי תמידים and when one can pray תפילות שחרית ומנחה; since the כבש בבוקר (which corresponds to תפילת שחרית) can only be brought from sunrise and the כבש של בין הארבים (which corresponds to תפילת המנחה) can only be brought until sunset, these hours must be measured from sunrise until sunset.

However, later Sepharadic authorities (such as the BI"Ḥ I Vayakhel VIII, Terumath Hadeshen siman 1 & Ohr Letzion vol. 2 pg. 147) have ruled to calculate this 1¼ seasonal hours backwards from the _Geonic Nightfall_ time. A further break from tradition is maintaining the length of the day measured from sunrise to sunset for this time, even though the window of time has moved entirely (Igur, end of Siman 327). As such, there is a difference of 13½ seasonal minutes between the two.

This debate trickles down to R' Ovadia and his sons, who are on both sides of the fence. R' Avraham Yosef ([Parashat Terumah 5779 shiur min 3:55](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/76371)) & R' Yitzhak Yosef ([Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 shiur min 37](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/81670), [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 shiur min 25](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/55391), Yalkut Yosef new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147) quote their father (Yabia Omer vol. 2 siman 21 num. 15) to use the later time from the BI"Ḥ, concerning themselves with a potential of blessings (of ערבית and הדלקת נרות) being said in vain. In contrast, R' David Yosef (in אוצרות יוסף בסוף הלכה ברורה חלק י"ד תשובה ז) maintains the minhag to use the times measured from sunrise to sunset, which negates the concern of reciting blessings in vain (as was also said by the Minḥat Kohen - Ma-amar II, end of 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. This is also applicable for סוף זמן תפילה, where we are not concerned for the MG"A seasonal hour calculation). Furthermore, calculating Plag using the Geonic nightfall was not done even by the Geonim themselves, since they explicitly said that these times are calculated from sunrise until sunset (nor could they have, since their calculated midday would not match the astronomical midday -- issue quoted by Shu"t Divreh Yosef Shwartz pg. 58 & R' Tukachinsky in the Sefer "Ben Hashmashot", pg. 98).

In R' Ovadia's later writings, in the section on how to calculate שעות היום (located in the Halikhot Olam above, in the same Parasha that discusses Minḥa times), there was no distinction made between Plag Haminḥa and other times. Based on the lack of explicit exception, one can assume he changed his time and adopted the position maintained by the Halacha Berurah for all Rabbinic matters. Even though outside rulings use the later Plag Haminḥa time (Hazon Ovadia Ta-anit pg. 94, Halikhot Olam vol. 1 pg. 223), it was written as such to hold by a position that one would be exempt according to the opinions that held by this later time. In similarity, R' David Yosef writes in the same style throughout his writings (אוצרות יוסף vs. הלכה ברורה on Siman 233 pg. 75) despite explicitly mentioning that he holds like the "Halacha Berurah" time.

Fun Fact: Authorities that hold by *Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall* typically calculate seasonal time from dawn until nightfall, since they are of equal length. However, maintaining the seasonal time from sunrise to sunset (as does the Ra'ah, Berachot 26b; Ritva, Berachot 27b; Ramban, Pesachim 54b - How short the walk between the two is, 33.3/2-000 vs 40/2000) while still defining the time of ערב as nightfall creates a time for פלג המנחה that only has **three minutes** of a time difference between the two. This introduces many difficulties (such as the inability to light Shabbat candles until then, as said by Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28), making it impossible to follow this shita without major risk of Shabbat descecration.

In most cases, one would follow the פלג המנחה of the Halacha Berurah. However, since קידוש is a Biblical commandment, one would need to recite קידוש after the Yalkut Yosef's time. (One can still recite the blessing of מקדש השבת in Arvit by the Halacha Berurah's time, since they will be exempt in the second קדושה done by the meal). This is only a concern, though, for people in far north areas using the **Amudeh Hora'ah** calendar, since nightfall happens much later in areas further from the equator
