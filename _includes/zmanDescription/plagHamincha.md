Plag Hamincha (literally "Half of Mincha") is the time that starts the transition into the evening, as some Halachot that forcefully start at night could optionally be done starting at this time.

- Within the matters of Shabbat, the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim, 273:4) holds that this is the earliest time one can transition into Shabbat, whether by accepting Shabbat or demonstrating that its candles are for the purposes of Shabbat.
- Rabbi Yehuda in the Talmud Bavli (Berachot 26a) holds that this is the earliest time one can start praying Arvit/Ma'ariv.

The time is calculated by picking an "end point" and calculating one and a quarter seasonal hours prior. This offset is given when factoring that the time between Mincha Ketanah and Shkiya is two and a half seasonal hours, and Plag Hamincha should span half as long. Although the negative offset is constant, where to apply this is what brings us to the two opinions of when Plag Hamincha takes place.

- Rabbi David Yosef's Halacha Brurah (as well as the Kaf Hachaim and Halichot Olam) holds that this offset is based on the time of Shkiya/Sunset. Thereby, it starts after one and a quarter seasonal hours of Mincha Ketanah's beginning.
- Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef's Yalkut Yosef holds that there is an additional offset of the time in between Shkiya and Tzeit Hakokhavim. This offset is calculated as 13.5 seasonal minutes after sunset (adjusted for elevation in the Ohr Hachaim Calendar or converted to degrees in the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar).
