Plag Hamincha is, as the hebrew name implies (Plag=half), the halftime point from Mincha Ketanah to Shekiya. A select few mitzvot of the night can start being done from now, such as accepting Shabbat early (Orach Chayim, 273:4) or praying the night time Tefilah when one already prayed Mincha (Berachot 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

When accounting for Mincha Ketanah's length being 2½ seasonal hours long from its start until Shekiya (of which this time is supposed to be close towards), half of that would be 1¼ seasonal hours. However, this time is actually calculated in reverse from the time called "ערב", which is unclear as to whether it refers to שקיעה (which starts entering a ספק לילה) or צאת הכוכבים (when it is לילה ודאי). The Rambam (Hilchot Tefilah 3:4), Kaf Hachaim (273:7), Halichot Olam (vol. 1 pg. 248) & Halacha Berurah all agree that we count backwards from Shekiya, being a more literal interpretation of the "half-point" treatment. However, the Ben Ish Hai, Ohr Letzion & Yalkut Yosef intrepret the word "ערב" to be the actual night; צאת הכוכבים (based on the Geonim). As such, this takes on a stringency of 13.5 seasonal minutes after the "lenient" position, since they still calculate the 1¼ seasonal hours according to the Vilna Gaon's sunrise to sunset method.

Among the calendars, the Ohr Hachaim calendar chooses to list only the Yalkut Yosef time. However, the Amudeh Hora'ah that has a later "Tzet Hakochavim" time lists both, possibly to account for places that there would be a grander difference. In practicality, while the Yalkut Yosef time is more ideal, one can rely on the Halacha Berurah time for Rabbinical commandments (such as Tefilah and Shabbat Candles).

Fun Fact: The Poskim we quoted who say that it works backwards from Tzet Hakochavim hold of the Geonic Tzet Hakochavim. However, if we were to maintain that one should work backwards off Tzet Hakochavim and apply it to Rabbenu Tam's Tzet Hakochavim, there would be little time between Plag Hamincha and the time of sunset (which the Ramban would calculate as ⅕<sup>th</sup> of a mil, therefore being 3 minutes and 36 seconds). Following that calculation (even as a stringency) creates severe Halachic implications, such as not being able to light Shabbat candles until 3 minutes before sunset (Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28). Nevertheless, this is a minority opinion amongst Sepharadi Poskim (Ra'ah, Berachot 26b; Ritva, Berachot 27b; Ramban, Pesachim 54b).
