Plag Hamincha is, as the hebrew name implies (Plag=half), the halftime point from Mincha Ketanah until Shekiya. A select few mitzvot of the night can start being done from now, such as accepting Shabbat early (Orach Chayim, 273:4) or praying the night time Tefilah when one already prayed Mincha (Berachot 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

The definitional method to calculate this time would be to measure the time between Mincha Ketanah and sunset (which spans 2½ seasonal hours, thereby making Plag Hamincha last 1¼ seasonal hours) and apply the split time backwards from the time called "ערב". Determining when "ערב" is, though, is a matter subject to debate depending on different methods of calculating time.
- The Ben Ish Hai (BI"H Year 1 Vayahakel VIII) & Ohr Letzion intrepret the word "ערב" to be referring to the Halachic nightfall of the Geonim. R' Yitzhak Yosef in his Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat v. 1 p. 168 263 fnt. 62; 235:1; 267:12) sides with this opinion, even saying so explicitly for praying Arvit (Shabbat 1-3, 5771 edition, pp. 143-146). In a few verbal shiurim (such as [Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 min 37](https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=81670) & [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 min 25](https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=55391)), he also holds that calendars who would print earlier times risks placing people into reciting blessings (of ערבית and הדלקת נרות) in vain.
- The Rambam (Hilchot Tefilah 3:4), Kaf Hachaim (233:7) & Halichot Olam (vol. 1 pg. 248) all maintain that we count backwards from sunset, being a more literal interpretation of the "half-point" treatment and has minhag-basis. This ends up in a time that is around 13.5 seaonsl minutes *earlier* than the position held by RYY. To respond to the concerns, the Halacha Berurah (חלק יד תשובה ז) rejects the basis of needing to calculate based on the Geonic nightfall, since the Geonim would follow their own seasonal hour calculation of sunrise->sunset.

Although both calendars provide the time of the Yalkut Yosef, the Ohr Hachaim calendar excludes the Halacha Berurah time in its printouts. It is ultimately up to each individual/community to decide which of the two is the opinion they hold by. For reference, the Poskim for our platform (Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz and Rabbi Leeor Dahan) hold that one can rely on the Halacha Berurah time for Rabbinic commandments.

Fun Fact: Between the opinions above, there are only 13.5 seasonal minutes of a difference, due to how short the window between sunset and halachic nightfall is. However, while keeping to the definition of "ערב" as halachic nightfall, there are other Poskim who would calculate this time from *Rabbenu Tam's* halachic nightfall, making for a window of *seventy-two* seasonal minutes instead of *thirteen and a half*. Since the entire time span of Plag Hamincha is only *seventy-five* seasonal minutes, there are only **three** minutes in between the two. One such Posek is the Ramban, who even acknowledges how little time there is by saying one can only walk 333 ⅓ *amot* between the two times (one must factor that they can only walk 2000 *amot* in a *mil*, which means one only walks slightly above 16% of a mil. When using an 18 minute mil, that gives us the answer above).

Following that calculation (even as a stringency) creates severe Halachic implications, such as not being able to light Shabbat candles until 3 minutes before sunset (Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28). Nevertheless, this is a minority opinion amongst Sepharadi Poskim (Ra'ah, Berachot 26b; Ritva, Berachot 27b; Ramban, Pesachim 54b), and it is possible that the Halacha Berurah would agree to this had the minhag *not* been to calculate using the Geonim's seasonal hours of sunrise to sunset (since his issue was a matter of inconsistency between following the Geonim and their seasonal hour calculations).
