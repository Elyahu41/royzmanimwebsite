Dawn is the time that rays of sun can be seen in the lit up Eastern part of the sky (Rosh, Brachot 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Yoma 3:1; Shulchan Aruch O.C. 89:1). Halachically, it is the time that we transition from night into day, where the new day's commandments can start being fulfilled (although in an unideal fasion; preferably, these should wait until הנץ החמה/sunrise. However, if one has already done it erroniously or has a pressing need, they are still exempt).

- The Night-Time Shema (when omitted due to negligence), Tikkun Hatzot, and the evening prayer are no longer recitable past this time
- Despite this being an unideal time to pray, considering that its obligation has started, one may no longer eat until the end of his prayer
- Tallit & Tefilin have separate rules from dawn and sunrise; that will be explained in the Misheyakir section

A debate is recorded in Pesachim Bavli (92b-94a) regarding when to determine Halachic times that aren't a portion of the day, such as sunset to nightfall and dawn to sunrise. Based on us holding by Rabbi Yehuda's position that the time interval is 4 "mil"'s, we could translate that to 72 minutes, based on every mil being 18 minutes (Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Brachot 1:1 & Shulchan Aruch O.C. 459:1).
- The Rambam in "Pe'er HaDor 44" (initially written in Arabic) clarifies how to determine what a "minute" is. The Minchat Kohen (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג)'s interpretation is that these minutes are seasonal, meaning they are proportionate based on how long a day is. To determine the length of these minutes, calculate a seasonal hour by dividing the time interval between sunrise and sunset into 12 parts, then divide that further to 60 parts. We follow this view based on the Ben Ish Hai (1<sup>st</sup> year: Vaera 5, Vayakhel 4, Tzav 8; 2<sup>nd</sup> year: Noach 7; Rav Pa'alim II: 2) and Maran zt'l (הליכות עולם ח"א: דף קו, רמח-רנ). This is also supported by the Mishnah Berurah (58:5) and Yalkut Yosef (58:3). 
- The definition of *calculative* nightfall (72 seasonal minutes) is not to be confused with what we *halachically* maintain nightfall is (13.5 seasonal minutes).

Whereas the Ohr Hachaim calendar uses this calculation regardless of the latitudinal discrepancies, the Amudeh Hora’ah calendar argues (based on several authoritative sources of early Acharonim) that this is erroneous. This is also supported astronomically, where the latitude degree increase on the globe also proportionately delays the time for nightfall and dawn. Instead, the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar dictates that each locale must determine its own number of seasonal minutes, based on its relation to Israel on an equinox day (where sunrise and sunset are aligned, which by default gives a control of fixed minutes). To calculate this, one needs to derive the level of darkness (measured by degrees) in the sky found in Israel by the desired time (in our case, 72 minutes before sunrise), which can then be applied as a percentage of the day to the desired locale.
