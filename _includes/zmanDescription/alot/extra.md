Times of desperate need may make these times too strict. In these cases, there are 2 earlier time calculations, which are 90 minutes and 96 minutes.

- 90 minutes can be reached in two ways; either counting the backwards-mil by 5 instead of 4 (as explained by Ulah and held by Rambam in Hilchot Korban Pesach 5:9) or holding like the Terumat Hadeshen that calculates Alot as being 1/8th of the day, with the day lasting 720 minutes
- 96 minutes can be achieved by switching the mil's length to last 24 minutes, based on his commentary to Massechet Pesachim.

Although these calculations work for commandment fulfilling, they will not work for saying a Bracha on them, as per the concept of ספק ברכות להקל.
