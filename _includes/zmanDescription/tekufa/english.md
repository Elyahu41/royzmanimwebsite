Tekufot are the Halachic equivalents of the yearly seasons, which we have four of yearly; Nissan/Spring, Tamuz/Summer, Tishri/Fall & Tevet/Winter. These are based on the solar year, due to being astronomical in nature. This is most commonly known for its attachment to the Beracha of ברך עלינו vs ברכנו in the Amidah (for those outside Eretz Yisrael), as determined from 60 days after Tekufat Tishri. (This currently corresponds to December 4th or December 5th, but the natural order of the world would make it continue to drift).

This time takes more importance in Kabalistic circles, though, where there is a warning (Rama on Yoreh De'ah 116:5) not to drink water during the time of the Tekufah switch (Pri Hadash, Ohr Hachaim, end of Siman 428; there is a potential of death). Due to the seriousness of it, many communities developed customs to have a "time-buffer" before and after. Although they range from 15 minutes (Hida, Shu"t Yosef Ometz, Siman 42) to 3 hours (מנהגי מהרי"ל בליקוטים של סימן נו), the common minhagim have been to wait either an hour and a half prior and following (Rabbi Mazuz on Djerban Minhagim; רמ"ך בברית כהונה - חלק אורח חיים מערכת ת' אותיות כ"א-כ"ה), or half an hour prior and following (נהר מצרים, דף עז ע"ב; ר' אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט"ז אות ה). Maran zt"l concludes like the latter of the two, as recorded in Halichot Olam, Chelek 7, Page 183.

To determine when the next Tekufah is, get the known date of the previous Tekufah and add the length of the year divided by the amount of seasons (4). The length of a year, according to Shemuel in Bavli Eruvin, 56a, is a rounded up version of the astronomical length of a year, for the sake of being easier to keep track of (Hazon Ish - OC Siman 138, se’if katan 4). Thereby, since his length of a year is 365.25 days, dividing it by 4 gives us 91 days, 7 hours and 30 minutes.

A further Makhloket is whether the first Tekufah used a fixed clock time of 12:00 PM or used local Israel Hatzot. Although the Ohr Hachaim calendar uses the fixed clock time like Rav Tuchanski does in his calendar, the תנובות שדה (Rav Aharon Boron) takes issue with this due to the arbitrary nature of a 12:00 midpoint. As such, the עמודי הוראה calendar (as well with the unofficial לוח ילקוט יוסף) uses the local Israel Hatzot time of 11:39 AM, which is only a -21 minute difference. For the water warning above, It is possible to accomodate both by starting the time period with R Boron's time and finishing by the time listed in the Ohr Hachaim calendar.
