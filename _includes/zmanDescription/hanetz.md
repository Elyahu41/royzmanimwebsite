Sunrise ("Hanetz") is the official beginning of the new Halachic day, where any day-dependent Mitzvot (Shofar, Lulav) can be done optimally. Although Maran zt"l himself wasn't time-precise when praying by this time (see Orchot Maran (volume 1) 7:5), many wait until the minute to ensure that the Tefilah of Shacharit is done by its proper time (Orach Hayim, 89:1)

The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) algorithm is used to determine the scientific sunrise for the current location, with a few changes to account for the Halachic world:
- Our astronomical definition for "Halachic Sunrise" only requires the uppermost edge of the solar sphere to be visible in the east [Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261, halacha 21) & Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 89 page 460)], which would be approximately six minutes prior to a full reveal of the sun above the horizon [Rambam on Hilchot Kriat Shema (1:11), based on the כסף משנה's גרסה, Rav Pa'alim Vol. II, Orach Hayim, Chapter 3]. For reference, the gentile default requires the sun to be halfway above the horizon.
- This is measured at "sea-level", where one would be able to see the sun would there not be any obstructions on a flat horizon. Elevation-based adjustments (measured in meters) are needed to calculate any GRA-based time in the Ohr Hachaim calendar.

Additionally, one can also switch to use "Visible Sunrise" times provided by the ChaiTables website, which uses its DTM (Data Table Map) to factor-in any horizontal obstruction. (Mishnah Brurah 588:2 based on Rashi & Ran on Megillah 20; Eshel Avraham Botchach, Orach Hayim 89; Yalkut Yosef, new edition, siman 89 page 51)
