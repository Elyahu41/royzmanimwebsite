Sunrise ("Hanetz") is the official beginning of the new Halachic day, where any day-dependent Mitzvot (Shofar, Lulav) can be done optimally. Although Maran zt"l himself wasn't time-precise when praying by this time (see Orchot Maran I 7:5), many wait until the minute to ensure that the Tefilah of Shacharit is done by its proper time (Orach Hayim, 89:1)

The astronomical way to determine this time is by seeing when the uppermost edge of the solar sphere is visible in the east [Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261, halacha 21) & Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 89 page 460)]. While the level of the law only requires it be visible should one stand at sea-level (meaning one would be able to see the sun would there not be any obstructions on a flat horizon), it is recommended to factor in the obstructions, even if it gives a later time [Mishnah Brurah 588:2 based on Rashi & Ran on Megillah 20; Eshel Avraham Botchach, Orach Hayim 89; Yalkut Yosef, new edition, siman 89 page 51].
- This astronomical times is approximately six minutes prior to a full solar reveal [Rambam on Hilchot Kriat Shema (1:11), based on the כסף משנה's גרסה, Rav Pa'alim Vol. II, Orach Hayim, Chapter 3]
- The base algorith made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) can give us the sea-level sunrise, and is used as default. However, we recommended one go through our dedicated "Visual Sunrise setup" to use the times reported by the ChaiTables website, which combines the NOAA-reported time with its internal DTM (Data Table-Map) to compute times for Visible Sunrise
