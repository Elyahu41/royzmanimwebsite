Passover Eve in the Biblical time was spent traveling to the Temple Mount during the time of בן הערבים (starts after the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour) to offer the קרבן פסח. Once the offering is brought, it is forbidden to own or derive benefit (including eating) from חמץ, as said in Exodus 34:25 - "לֹֽא־תִשְׁחַ֥ט עַל־חָמֵ֖ץ דַּם־זִבְחִ֑י". In specific, violating this prohibition transgresses a negative commandment, which is learned out from the *Asmakhta* of "וְזָבַ֥חְתָּ פֶּ֛סַח לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ...לֹא־תֹאכַ֤ל עָלָיו֙ חָמֵ֔ץ" (Deuteronomy 16:2-3. Codification began from Rabbi Yehuda, Pesaḥim Bavli 28b; later codified in two foremost authorities [רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי"] and other Rishonim [רב יצחק אבן גיאת ז"ל בשם הרא"ש ומגיד משנה]). During the times where one is unable to bring the offering, the verse is reinterpreted as referring to the prohibition time-wise - "זְמַן שְׁחִיטָה אָמַר רַחֲמָנָא" (Pesaḥim Bavli 5b).

As a separate identity from the קרבן פסח, there is a separate status tied to the day of ערב חג הפסח itself; from the verse of אַ֚ךְ בַּיּ֣וֹם הָרִאשׁ֔וֹן תַּשְׁבִּ֥יתוּ שְּׂאֹ֖ר מִבָּתֵּיכֶ֑ם (Exodus 12:15), the Talmud (Pesaḥim Bavli 5a) questions how one can perform תשביתו on the first day when there is already a prohibition to own their Ḥametz (בל יראה ובל ימצא). To resolve the contradiction, the Talmud explains that the ה in הראשון is meant to allude to the day *before* the first, which is ערב חג. Then, we use the word "אך" from the verse to divide the day in half, where the first half is dedicated for the מצוה of תשביתו and the second half is the time for the prohibition.

Due to concerns about potentially mistaking this time on a cloudy day, there is an additional rabbinic safeguard to refrain from all activities by the *beginning* of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour. Additionally, Rabbi Yehuda further restricted eating חמץ by the beginning of the 5<sup>th</sup> hour (Mishna Pesaḥim 1:4; Pesaḥim Bavli 12b; Rambam Hilchot Hametz Umatzah 1:9).

These hours are calculated by dividing the time from *Dawn* until *Nightfall* into 12 timeframes, called "seasonal hours". Although the usual method of calculating seasonal hours is from sunrise until sunset, we are stringent on חמץ to consider these two Rabbinic times through the seasonal hours normally reserved for Biblical times (as recorded in the Pri Ḥadash, beginning of Siman 443 & Ḥazon Ovadia II pg. 37), such as Keriath Shema.
- Ḥazon Ovadia - Pesach I pg. 60 & Yalkut Yosef on Pesach (5775 edition) pg. 652 record a leniency for children to use the seasonal hours from sunrise->sunset if they still want to eat Hametz. This time would match what we report for "Sof Zeman Berakhoth Shema"
- To calculate as such in a synchronized fashion (so that the midpoint of both sunrise->sunset + Dawn->Nightfall line up), one would need to measure Tzet Hakokhavim by Rabbenu Tam's time; otherwise, there is a missing 58.5 minutes between the time of the Geonic Tzet Hakokhavim and Rabbenu Tam's (counterpoint would be the Ben Ish Ḥai's calculations, which are indeed shifted by that time).
