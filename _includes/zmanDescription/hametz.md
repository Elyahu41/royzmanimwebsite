Even before חג הפסח itself, we find a Biblical command forbidding ownership, eating or benefit-deriving from חמץ on ערב חג after בין הערבים - the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour. Abaye in Pesachim 5a learns it out from a seeming contradiction in the commandment to perform תשביתו on your חמץ during the day of "הראשון" when there is an explicit prohibition (בל יראה ובל ימצא) to own חמץ during all seven days (this count of seven naturally includes the first, which is what "הראשון" translates to). Solving this contradiction involves reinterpreting יום הראשון to discuss the day prior to חג הפסח. The word "אך" is there to split this day into two, where the second half would be forbidden for חמץ.

This time period of בן הערבים starts by the time people would bring the קרבן פסח, from which it is forbidden to own, derive benefit from or eat חמץ, as said in Exodus 34:25 - "לֹֽא־תִשְׁחַ֥ט עַל־חָמֵ֖ץ דַּם־זִבְחִ֑י". Although we do not have the ability to bring the קרבן פסח in our days, "זְמַן שְׁחִיטָה אָמַר רַחֲמָנָא" - it is referring to the time of slaughtering the קרבן פסח. One that eats during this time transgresses a negative commandment, as per Rabbi Yehuda (Pesachim Bavli 28b), two Amudeh Hora'ot (רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי") and other Rishonim (רב יצחק אבן גיאת ז"ל בשם הרא"ש ומגיד משנה) due to a learned *Asmakhta* of "וְזָבַ֥חְתָּ פֶּ֛סַח לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ...לֹא־תֹאכַ֤ל עָלָיו֙ חָמֵ֔ץ" (Deuteronomy 16:2-3).

As safeguarders, there is a rabbinical decree to add an exta hour to all prohibition, meaning the חמץ has to be burnt five hours into the day. On top of that, Rabbi Yehuda (in Pesachim Bavli 12b) added another hour where one cannot eat חמץ, concerned with the potential of a cloudy day confusing the time. (Mishnah Pesachim 1:4, Rambam Hilchot Hametz Umatzah 1:9)

These hours are calculated by dividing the time from *dawn* until *nightfall* into 12 timeframes, called "seasonal hours". Although the usual method of calculating seasonal hours is from sunrise until sunset, we are stringent on חמץ to consider these two Rabbinic times through the seasonal hours normally reserved for Biblical times (as recorded in the Pri Hadash, beginning of Siman 443 & Hazon Ovadia II pg. 37), such as Keriath Shema.
- Hazon Ovadia - Pesach I pg. 60 & Yalkut Yosef on Pesach (5775 edition) pg. 652 record a leniency for children to use the seasonal hours from sunrise->sunset if they still want to eat Hametz. This time would match what we report for "Sof Zeman Berachoth Shema"
- To calculate as such in a synchronized fashion (so that the midpoint of both sunrise->sunset + alot->tzet line up), one would need to measure Tzet Hakochavim by Rabbenu Tam's time; otherwise, there is a missing 58.5 minutes between the time of the Geonic Tzet Hakochavim and Rabbenu Tam's (counterpoint would be the Ben Ish Hai's calculations, which are indeed shifted by that time).
