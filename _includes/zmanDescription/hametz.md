Even before the night of Pesach itself (the 15th), we find a Biblical prohibition to own and derive benefit from Hametz on Erev Pesach following midday. There are two places we learn this rule from:

- Pesachim Bavli 5a introduces the verse in Exodus 12:15 - "שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָמִים֙ מַצּ֣וֹת תֹּאכֵ֔לוּ אַ֚ךְ בַּיּ֣וֹם הָרִאשׁ֔וֹן תַּשְׁבִּ֥יתוּ שְּׂאֹ֖ר מִבָּתֵּיכֶ֑ם". Since we already have a prohibition to own Hametz for all seven days, how would we have Hametz to perform תשביתו on for the first day? Thereby, our Hakhamim reinterpret the day quoted in the verse to discuss the day prior to Pesach. The word "אך" is there to split this day into two, where the second half would be forbidden for Hametz.
- There is an additional prohibition to eat Hametz when the Korban Pesach would have been brought, based on an *Asmakhta* (learned out in Pesachim Bavli 28b) of "וְזָבַ֥חְתָּ פֶּ֛סַח לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ...לֹא־תֹאכַ֤ל עָלָיו֙ חָמֵ֔ץ" (Deuteronomy 16:2-3). The Mishnah Berurah (443:1:1) brings down that in our days without the Korban Pessach, this is now referring to the time that one would have brought the Korban Pessach (which is called בין הערבים). The עוז והדר משנה ברורה המבואר brings a different verse for this idea: "לֹֽא־תִשְׁחַ֥ט עַל־חָמֵ֖ץ דַּם־זִבְחִ֑י" (Exodus 34:25)

However, there is a special Rabbinic safeguard (in the name of Rabbi Meir) to add an extra hour, thereby requiring to burn it by the beginning of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour (meaning the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> hour). On top of that, Rabbi Yehuda (in Pesachim Bavli 12b) has the concern of a cloudy day potentially confusing the time. Thereby, the final Halacha is that one needs to stop eating by the beginning of the 5<sup>th</sup> hour and burn it by the beginning of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour. (Mishnah Pesachim 1:4, Rambam Hilchot Hametz Umatzah 1:9)

These hours are calculated by dividing the time from *Alot Hashachar* until *Tzet Hakokhavim* into 12 timeframes, called "seasonal hours". Although we usually only calculate this way for Keriath Shema due to its Biblical nature, we are stringent for the matter of Hametz on Pesach as well (as recorded in the Pri Hadash, beginning of Siman 443 & Hazon Ovadia II pg. 37).
- Yalkut Yosef on Pesach (5775 edition) pg. 652 records a leniency for children to use the seasonal hours from sunrise->sunset if they still want to eat Hametz. This time would match what we report for "Sof Zman Berachot Shema"
- To calculate as such in a synchronized fashion (so that the midpoint of both sunrise->sunset + alot->tzet line up), one would need to measure Tzet Hakochavim by Rabbenu Tam's time; otherwise, there is a missing 58.5 minutes between the time of the Geonic Tzet Hakochavim and Rabbenu Tam's (counterpoint would be the Ben Ish Hai's calculations, which are indeed shifted by that time).
