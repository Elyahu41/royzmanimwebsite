- **Name Search:** Search for a location by its name using the input field below, and submit it by hitting the "Enter" key on your keyboard (or the search icon on the left of the input field). As you type out your input, auto-complete suggestions will appear.
- **ZIP Search:** Using a ZIP code instead of a location name will open a new menu, where you could narrow down your location from the ZIP code. This is needed to accomodate other countries that may use the same postal code, as well as ZIP codes that [cover too much ground](https://kosherjava.com/2018/09/05/zip-codes-and-zmanim-use-with-care/).
- **Location Detector:** Use your GPS coordinates (as given by your web browser; VPNs and proxies will affect this result) to use your precise location for the calculations. You will need to give the website browser permission.
- **Manual (Advanced):** Input customized longtitude and latitude inputs. Useful for the most precision.
