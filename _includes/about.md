Welcome to the זמני יוסף website, where we calculate Halachic times based on the teachings of HaRav Ovadia Yosef ZT"L and other Sepharadic leaders for each user according to their location. Beyond relying on what he's written throughout his Sefarim (quoted in the description of each time slot), our reported times can match either of the two following calendars:

- The **Ohr Hachaim** calendar was made by *Rabbi Shelomo Benizri* of Yeshivat "Ohr Hachaim". This is the calendar Maran zt"l used in Israel, as well as what R' Yitzhak Yosef says to use outside Eretz Yisrael (עין יצחק ג' דף ר"ל).
- The **Amudeh Horaah** calendar was made for places outside Eretz Yisrael by *Rabbi Leeor Dahan*, author of the Mishnah Berurah commentary of that same name. These use adjusted-seasonal minutes for dawn/night-based Halachic times, as an interpretation of R' David Yosef's Halacha Berurah (סימן רס"א ה' י"ג).

Calculations found on our platform (website and app) are typically more precise for specific geocoordinates than PDFs that need to account for a town as a whole. We benefit from this by introducing a **visible sunrise** option, which needs to be as precise as 2-8km. (More information on that can be found in the description for sunrise)
- Calendars using the outdated USNO algorithm will always be [inaccurate](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim/commit/b69dc31cf041279523fc9a4a6ac06912736487bb). With its newer version being closed-sourced (and thus inaccessible to any calendar), we instead use the NOAA algorithm.
- Although we _technically_ calculate down to nanosecond level, we only guarantee reliability to the minutes since seconds and beyond are **unreliable** for practical use.

Descriptions included with each halachic time come with the relevant sources on how to calculate them as well as explanations of the halachic position. Our terminology usage should be accessible to anyone looking to learn more on the matter, regardless of ethnic background (for Ashkenazim) or alternative approaches to the subject (including those who haven't learned it at all).
- Our sources are pulled primarily from Rabbi Ovadia's teachings and the system he based himself on, including the three Amudeh Horaah's (Rambam, Rif & Rosh), R Yosef Cairo's works (Bet Yosef & Shulḥan Arukh) as well as books written by Rabbi Ovadia and correspondents themselves. Although they can be found throughout the relevant responsa's, they have been compiled in the הוראה ברורה section of Rabbi Leeor Dahan's משנה ברורה: עמידי הוראה III. In addition, they have been summarized for the introduction to Siman 261 in R' David Yosef's הלכה ברורה.
- The codebase we wrote based on these teachings is fully open-source, hosted on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Elyahu41/royzmanimwebsite).
