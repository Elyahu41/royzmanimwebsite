### Source quoting guide

1. From the Rishonim, focus primarily on the three Amudeh Hora'ah's - Rif, Rambam & Rosh. Only afterwards quote Ramban (not prevalent except for Tzet & Plag), Rashba, Ran, Mordechi & Sefer Mitzvot Gedholoth.
  - This is to copy the commentary style of the Shulchan Aruch - see Halichot Olam introduction in vol. I.
  - For Rambam, use the Q'afiḥ girsa.
2. Acharonim should be limited to the Shulchan Aruch/Bet Yosef, Ben Ish Hai, Mishnah Berurah (because of commentaries like the עמודי הוראה) and any of R' Yitzhak, R' David or R' Ovadiah's Sefarim.
3. Video/audio sources should be kept to a minimum. However, if so, please only quote TorahAnytime videos. (YouTube _can_ be used, but switch `youtube.com` or `youtu.be` to `vid.puffyan.us` - an Invidious instance hosted in the United States)
