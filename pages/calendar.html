				</summary>
				<div class="accordianContent">
					<p>This zman determines the beginning of the Halachic day, placing an end to the time of any night-time based Mitzvah (ie: Arvit).<br>
					When there is a Sha'at Hadachak (in a time of need) situation, mitzvot that are dependent on the daytime could be done starting now. Similarly, if any mitzvah was performed during this time, they are exempt bediavad (after the fact) even if not during a Sha'at Hadachak situation.</p>

					<p>The Ohr Hachaim calendar uses 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR"A) before sunrise to calculate the time. Similarly, elevation is included in the calculation. However, the Amudeh Hora'ah Calendar factors in an equinox calculation too.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">As a sidepoint, Alot HaShachar (עלות השחר) gets its name from the verse in Genesis 32:25. In the Talmud, it goes by the title of Amud Hashachar (עמוד השחר).</p>
	
					<p>In Tanach this time is called Alot HaShachar (בראשית לב:כה), whereas in the gemara it is called Amud HaShachar.</p>
					<p>This is the time when the day begins according to halacha. Most mitzvot (commandments), Arvit for example, that take place at night are not allowed to be done after this time.<br>
					After this time, mitzvot that must be done in the daytime are allowed to be done B'dieved (after the fact) or B'shaat hadachak (in a time of need). However, one should ideally wait until sunrise to do them L'chatchila (optimally).</p>
		
					<p class="mb-0">This time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR"A) before sunrise. Both sunrise and sunset have elevation included.</p>

				<div class="accordianContent">
					<p>Misheyakir (literally "when you recognize") is the time when a person can distinguish between blue and white. The gemara (ברכות ט) explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for shacharit.</p>
					<p>This time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).</p>
					<p class="mb-0">Note: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave early in the morning to travel, however, normally a person should put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50 regular minutes) before sunrise.</p>

				</summary>
				<div class="accordianContent">
					<p>This is the earliest time when all mitzvot (commandments) that are to be done during the daytime are allowed to be performed L'chatchila (optimally). Halachic sunrise is defined as the moment when the top edge of the sun appears on the horizon while rising. Whereas, the gentiles define sunrise as the moment when the sun is halfway through the horizon. This halachic sunrise is called mishor (sea level) sunrise and it is what many jews rely on when praying for Netz.</p>
					<p class="mb-0">However, it should be noted that the Shulchan Aruch writes in Orach Chayim 89:1, "The mitzvah of shacharit starts at Netz, like it says in the pasuk/verse, 'יראוך עם שמש'". Based on this, the poskim write that a person should wait until the sun is VISIBLE to say shacharit. In Israel, the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses a table of sunrise times from the luach/calendar 'לוח ביכורי יוסף' (Luach Bechoray Yosef) each year. These times were made by Chaim Keller, creator of the ChaiTables website. Ideally, you should download these VISIBLE sunrise times from his website with the capability of this app to use for the year. However, if you did not download the times, you will see 'Mishor' or 'Sea Level' sunrise instead.</p>
