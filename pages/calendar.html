            In Tanach, this time is called Alot HaShachar (בראשית לב:כה),
            whereas in the Gemara it is called Amud HaShachar.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the time when the day begins according to halacha. Most
            mitzvot (commandments), Arvit for example, that take place at night
            are not allowed to be done after this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this time, mitzvot that must be done in the daytime are
            allowed to be done B'dieved (after the fact) or B'shaat hadachak (in
            a time of need). However, one should ideally wait until sunrise to
            do them L'chatchila (optimally).
          </p>
          <p>
            This time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according
            to the GR\"A) before sunrise. Both sunrise and sunset have elevation
            included.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
            how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees
            (16.1) before sunrise on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set
            around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them
            zmaniyot according to the GR\"A, and we subtract that time from
            sunrise to get the time for Alot Hashachar. This is according to the
            Halacha Berurah, and this should only be done outside of Israel in
            more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do
            this because it is more according to the nature of the world.
            However, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the
            Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in
            Luach Amudei Horaah mode.

            Misheyakir (literally "when you recognize") is the time when a
            person can distinguish between blue and white. The Gemara (ברכות ט)
            explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue
            (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest
            time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for Shacharit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the earliest time one can say Shema L'chatchila
            (optimally).
          </p>
          <p>
            This time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to
            the GR\"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave
            early in the morning to travel. However, normally a person should
            put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50
            regular minutes) before sunrise.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
            how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees
            (16.1) before sunrise on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set
            around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them
            zmaniyot according to the GR\"A, and we subtract 5/6 of that time
            from sunrise to get the time for Misheyakir. This is according to
            the Halacha Berurah, and this should only be done outside of Israel
            in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do
            this because it is more according to the nature of the world.

            This is the earliest time when all mitzvot (commandments) that are
            to be done during the daytime are allowed to be performed
            L'chatchila (optimally). Halachic sunrise is defined as the moment
            when the top edge of the sun appears on the horizon while rising.
            Whereas, the gentiles define sunrise as the moment when the sun is
            halfway through the horizon. This halachic sunrise is called mishor
            (sea level) sunrise and it is what many jews rely on when praying
            for Netz.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            However, it should be noted that the Shulchan Aruch writes in Orach
            Chayim 89:1, "The mitzvah of shacharit starts at Netz, like it says
            in the pasuk/verse, 'יראוך עם שמש'". Based on this, the poskim write
            that a person should wait until the sun is VISIBLE to say shacharit.
            In Israel, the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses a table of sunrise times
            from the luach/calendar 'לוח ביכורי יוסף' (Luach Bechoray Yosef)
            each year. These times were made by Chaim Keller, creator of the
            ChaiTables website. Ideally, you should download these VISIBLE
            sunrise times from his website with the capability of this app to
            use for the year. However, if you did not download the times, you
            will see 'Mishor' or 'Sea Level' sunrise instead.

            (Mid-day). However, if the zmaniyot/seasonal minutes are longer, we
            use those minutes instead to be stringent. The GR"A calculates a
            zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset
            (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we
            divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal
            minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as
            above except no elevation is included.

            Halachic sunset is defined as the moment when the top edge of the
            sun disappears on the horizon while setting (elevation included).
            Whereas, the gentiles define sunset as the moment when the sun is
            halfway through the horizon.

          <p>
            Immediately after the sun sets, Bein Hashmashot/twilight starts
            according to the Geonim, however, according to Rabbeinu Tam the sun
            continues to set for another 58.5 minutes and only after that Bein

            horizon on an equal day, then we add that amount of zmaniyot minutes
            to sunset to get the time of Tzeit/Nightfall. We use 3.86 degrees

            after sunset in Israel.

            It is brought down in Halacha Berurah that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL
            was once traveling in New York and he said to his son, Rabbi David
            Yosef Shlita, that the fast ends 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset.
            However, in his sefer Chazon Ovadiah, he writes that the fast ends
            20 minutes after sunset.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Ohr HaChaim calendar, they write that the fast ends at Tzait
            Hacochavim. I asked Rabbi Benizri if this meant that the fast ends
            at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset and he said, "Not necessarily,
            a person can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset if he wants to
            be stringent." I then asked him if those 20 minutes are zmaniyot
            minutes or regular minutes and he said, "Regular minutes."
          </p>
          <p>
            If a person wants to end the fast at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after
            sunset, he has the right to do so. However, if a person wants to be
            stringent, he can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset.

          <p>
            This time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset
            (elevation included). According to Rabbeinu Tam, these 72 minutes
            are made up of 2 parts. The first part is 58 and a half minutes
            until the second sunset (see Pesachim 94a and Tosafot there). After
            the second sunset, there are an additional 13.5 minutes until

          <p>
            The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time
            between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into
            12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get
            a zmaniyot/seasonal minute in order to calculate 72 minutes. Another
            way of calculating this time is by calculating how many minutes are
            between sunrise and sunset. Take that number and divide it by 10,
            and then add the result to sunset. The app uses the first method.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
            how many minutes are between sunset and 72 minutes as degrees (16.0)
            after sunset on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12
            hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot
            according to the GR\"A, and we add that time to sunset to get the
            time for Rabbeinu Tam. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and
            should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern
            areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do this because it is more
            according to the nature of the world; however, it does not seem like
            Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the Yalkut Yosef agrees with this
            opinion. Elevation is not included in Luach Amudei Horaah mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L was of the opinion
            to keep the zmaniyot zman of Rabbeinu Tam whether or not it fell out
            before or after 72 regular minutes after sunset. However, in Luach
            Amudei Horaah mode, we use the lesser of the two times.
