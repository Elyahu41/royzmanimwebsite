#### ברוך דיין האמת, חיים שאול בן אסתר

May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2002 - November 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024

A camper of Camp Simcha...talmid of Yeshivat Bet Midrash LeTalmud...member of Congregation Be'er Hagolah...and a dear friend to everyone.<br>
There isn't enough words to describe everything you've done for whoever and whenever there was your help needed.

- When everyone in your camp had an opportunity to make a wish and have it granted, you wanted [a sefer tora for your Kanissa](https://bukharianjewishlink.com/index.php/more/community/1743-hachnasat-sefer-torah-at-be-er-hagolah-donated-by-shaul-niyazov).
- Ḥavruta with someone who would only study Nakh in a Gemara-based Yeshiva? You filled that slot!
- Overhearing someone describing their depression? You weren't a therapist but with how you sidelined any of their concern, it would have certainly been suitable for you.

There were many other things you've done, and had you lived longer (you were only 22 on that sad day), we know you would have done so much more! Thank you for giving us a framework of what it meant to be someone that could change the world.

It was Ḥaim Shaul's wish for us to continue with Zemaneh Yosef. It was his wish to see a fully Russian version so he could spread around with his community. He translated the flyers we spread around the Queens Bukharian community. Most importantly, when the going got tough with intellectual dishonesty, his encouragement made me continue providing.<br>
One personal story: Our learning once got sidetracked where we started to talk about our pasts. As we were progressing to the high school days, he mentioned his life took a "much appreciated" flip-in-script as he described his first battle with cancer. I assumed the statement was sarcastic, and starting uttering the words "I'm sorry to hear". He did not give me the chance, though, as he meant that in all honesty; the friends he made from his situations were ones that he would not make under a normal health circumstance.<br>
As I later found out, this discussion came up before numerous times, and each time he was able to say it with the same Shevach to Hakadosh Barukh Hu. To put it in his words: "Overall, it was good and I thank Hashem that I had cancer. I didn't know what cancer was and now I learned it first hand with what it entailed. I saw Chai Lifeline's logo and motto in a lot of places, but I didn't really know what they did until my case manager visited me in the hospital. I met my chavrusa in the radiation center and I finished megillah with him 1 1&frasl;2 times. I agree that not a lot of people can say that ['I thank Hashem I had cancer'], but as we know, everything that happens to us is good. Even if it is worse as getting cancer, it is good; We just have to think about what happened in the middle, and after to realize that if this didn't happen to me, I would not have been the person I am."

You may be gone now (and it's certainly hard to cope with that reality), but the impact you left on us will certainly be felt.<br>
I am very proud to have met you and worked alongside you throughout it all. You may not be here to see the app fully in Russian but your flyer works will still be used in local communities (newspapers, statuses and more)<br>
Thank you

May all the activity on our platform be לעלוי נשמתך.

From a dear friend<br>
