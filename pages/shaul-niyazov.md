#### ברוך דיין האמת, חיים שאול בן אסתר

A camper of Camp Simcha...talmid of Yeshivat Bet Midrash LeTalmud...member of Congregation Be'er Hagolah...translator of Zemaneh Yosef for our Russian flyers...and a dear friend to everyone.<br>
There isn't enough words to describe everything you've done for whoever and whenever there was your help needed.

- A sefer torah needed? You were [on top of that](https://bukharianjewishlink.com/index.php/more/community/1743-hachnasat-sefer-torah-at-be-er-hagolah-donated-by-shaul-niyazov).
- Ḥavruta with someone who would only study Nakh? That slot was filled!
- Overhearing someone describing their depression? You weren't a therapist but with how you sidelined any of their concern, it would have certainly been suitable for you.

You may be gone now (and it's certainly hard to cope with that reality), but the impact you left on us will certainly be felt.

One personal Ma'aseh: As we were learning and talking, we were both discussing our pasts. As we were progressing to the high school days, he mentioned his life took a "much appreciated" flip-in-script as he described his first battle with cancer. I thought there was sarcasm detected, and starting uttering the words "I'm sorry to hear". He did not give me the chance, though, as he meant that in all honesty; the friends he made from his situations were ones that he would not make under a normal health circumstance.<br>
Even as life and death faced him in the teenager years, the way he was able to reflect back on it is just one way that he turned everything for the better. That's the definition of Hakarat HaTov!

I am very proud to have met you and worked alongside you throughout it all. You may not be here to see the app fully in Russian but your flyer works will still be used in local communities (newspapers, statuses and more)<br>
Thank you

May all the activity on our platform be לעלוי נשמתך.

From a dear friend<br>
~Maor Moshe Na'im
